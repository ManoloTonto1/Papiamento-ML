Warme dagen zwoele nachten
Dat is Gronings beste kant
A zijn er niet veel grachten
Toch is het een heel fijn land
Mooie winkels dr cm van rnensen
Ziet men in de Berenstraat
Wat men ook zou kunnen wensen
Keurig alles wat er staatoNeem eens de Martinitoren
Dat is Gronings grote trots
Yroeger zong men er in koren
Allemaal ter ere Gods

Wat daar opvalt zijn do vrouwen
Die gaan altijd mooi gekleed
Men heeft er feel veel keus bij trouwen
Men is getrouwd eer men het weet
Katholieken Protestanten
Zijn er alien even vrocm
Hoe men t keert naar alle kanten
Allen koesteren dezelfde droom
Ik zal nu mijn gedicht maar sluiten
eviAlles prima wat ik treet
Over Groningen te uiten
Een land dat ik nooit vergeet

Peze week had ik een gesprek me a een jongedame en een jongeman
die dit jaar beiden voor bun Mulo diploma zijn geslaagd
Het gesprek verliep niet erg bevredigend en ik bleef er na
afloop over peinzen
rgens zo dacht ik zit er lets scheef Het toeval vilde
dat een redacteur van Bao di Kwihi in inijn klas kwam en vroeg
hoe veal jongens zich ophun krant vilden abonneren
Een jaar lang al lees ik Bao di Kwihi met veel plezier en i
ik dacht waarom zou ik deze gesprekken niet navertellen Mis
schien heeft iemand van het La Salle College of Maria College
de moed om comaentaar te geven Het probleem is nl nog niet
opgelost Eerst de jongeman
Meneer ik heb nog geen work ben dit jaar geslaagd en zou
graag nog iets gaan studerenKunt U mij iets adviseren
Ik Van veachillende kranten heb ik gehoord dat er op Aruba
veel gebrek is an mensen die Boekhouden hebben gestudeerd
Voel je niets voor deze studie
Si j Sorry Meneer dat is nietsvcor mij want ik heb Mulo
met wiskunde als ik Boekhouden had villen loren was ik er in
de de klas al mao begonnen
Ik Jammer maar je zou het alsnog kunnen doen
Hij Boekhouden is voor diegenen die te dom zijn voor wis
kunde niet voor mij Maar Meneer missohien ga ikVolgend
jaar naar de Statesom tochniek te studoren
iLka danzou misachien een cursus Engelse Conversatie iets
voor jp zijn
HijMaar Meneer ik kail toch niet iets gaan loren wat ik
al keni Engels heb ik op de Mulo al goleerd
Ie jongedames i
Zij wilde Ned Handel sc orrespbndentie leren Er werd eon boek
gelcocht Set lste godeelte bestond uit het maken van thomas
oals voorzetsels invullen van twee hoofdzinnen een samenge
stelde zin maken met behulp van een voegwoord enz
Iks Je koopt maar een woordenboek en dan begin je Opzoeken wat
je hie twee t en themas maken Ik corrigeer het work Do oefenin
gen vormen een verlengstuk van wat je op de Mulo hebt ge leer cl
dus doe je best
Zijs Moet ik die therna s zomaar maken meneer Dat is toch
de omgekeerde were Id iIks Hoezo je weet toch hoe het moet
Zijs Maar meneer H moet de therna s eerst maken dan leer
ik ze thuis en dan ken ik ze zo deden we het op school ook
IK HEB MOVER NAGEDACHT EN IK DOE
HET EIGnNLIJK NOGIK VBAAG ME ill
Waarom Iciest iemand Mulo met wiskunde als er op Aruba veel
gebrek is aan Boekhouden
Is Boekhouden alleen voor de dommen
YJaarom is er zo we ini g animo voor deze studie Ik ken honder
den mens en die Steno Typen Conversatie Correspondentie ens
leren Voor Boekhouden ken ik er k tien of elf
Kan ik veronderstellen dat iemand met een Mulodiploma zelf
standig vender lean studeren of is dit teveel gevraagd
N B De jongemandie al Engels kende dat is niet son pro
bleem ik heb hem gevraagd of hij een avond vrij had dan kan
ik er nog wat bijleren je bent er nl nooit te oud voor
Mhr Engelbaerts
Ik was nogal verrast toen een meisje dat tot de redactie
van een schoolkrant bleek te behoren mij vroeg om iets over mijn
leven te schrijven Tifet een eer ltT zei ik TtEetilijkt wel een beet
je moeilijk Maar ja ik zal het proberen Dus hier volgt dan het
beloofde stukje
fs Morgens werden we afgehaald
Het was op een leerfabriek waar ik ter were Id kwaui Niet
lang daarna dus nog piep jong verd ik met nog enkele kameraadjes
naar Aruba gestuurd en kwamen op onze voorlopige verblijfplaats
We konden zelfs niet voldoende uitrusten na die lange rdis want
diekelfde namiddag stonden we in een etalage te pronken
Hemeltje lief Ik kan me nog goed herinneren hoe eng dat was
A die ogen op je gerichtJ En kritiek dat je kreeg te horenf
Enfin over smaak valt niet te twisten
Daar ik niet graag te lang in de hete zon wilde blijven en
ook niet met een paar centimeters stof wilde bedekt worden
gedroeg ik me als iemand van prima kwaliteit
En warempel nog de andere morgen Kreeg ik een bazin
Maar eerst werd ik van alle kanten bekeken en nog eens bekeken
totdat ja de beslissing viel op mij J fWat een gelukl M
dacht ik Doch later bleek dat ik ongelijk had
De eerste September maakte ik kennis met nieuwe vriedjes en
met de school van mijn bazin Die eerste weken werd ik ook flink
verwend en ik voelde me ook wat trots En tegen mijn vrindjes
blufte ik dan Zeg ik zie d netter uit dan jullie en ik heb
thuis een ere plaats op een tafeltje waar het heerlijk fris isT
Dan keken de anderen een beetje sip Maar toen kwam het verschrik
kelijke Ik ontdekte dat ik niet rneer zo lief werd behandeld en
ik werd een beetje verdrietigLater werd het erger Ik werd raaar met boeken en spullen
vol gepropt en dan thuis zomaar in een hoek gegooidAls de jonge dame te veel huiswerk kreeg dan kreeg ik de
hele tijd gebrom te horen En als zij weer iets lastigs te leren
kreeg dan kreeg ik er voor op mijn kop Als of een arme schooltas
het helpen kan datzij zoTn taak opgekregen had I
Was ik maar in die winkel gebleveni Misschien zou het er
veel leuker zijnl
life ken maanden jaren gingen voorbij en ook aan mijn
eentonigc moeilijk leven kwam een einde Maar nu heb ik ein
delijk rust gekregen en breng
mijn laatste dagen door in een o o o o o o go o

We zaten midden in de Centrale Proefwerken vlk voor de over
gang Dagen waaraan geen einde scheen te komen en waarin wij
ons extra flink op de studie toelegden
Bet werk was werkelijk fpikantM met het gevolg dat het veel
van ons verstand en van onze zenuwen vergdeJ
Ivlaar eindelijk was alles toch achter de rug De leus af
vachten hielden we haast niet meer uit De spanning steeg met
de dag en de barometer van het Maria College stond op barsten
Men werd cm een kleinigheidje afgesnauwd door de hyperner
veuze klas of iiever gezegd lotgenootjes Kon er niet eens meer
een vriendelijk woord vanaf  MeenJ T
Gelukkig begrepen we elkaar volkomen zodat er geen kinderachtige
ruzie t je s ont st onde n
Maar later werd de spanning oogevoerd tot HOOGs panning
Dat was de middag waarop de ouders het rapport in ontvangst zou
den komen nemen
Mijn huisgenoten plaagden mij het arme zusje ombarmfeartig
zodat ik mijn toevlucht in mijn kamer ocht Maar lang kon ik het
hier niet uithouden dus besloot ik mijn ouders tegemoet te gaan
Achter mij hoorde ik spottende uitroepen van de kleintjes en ik
verdacht mijn grote plaagzieke broer er sterk van dat hij ze
aanzette cm me van ale s na te schreeuwen
Ha dat was voorbij en daar zag ik vader en moeder ook
al aahkomen wandelen Ik er op een holletje naar toe Op hun
gezichten was vreugde te lezen en dat was voor mij genoeg
om te weten waar ik aan toe was
Midden in de onvermijdelijke knuffelpartijen nota bene
zomaar op straat rukte ik me los want ik had het verraderlijke
withe kaftje uit moeders tasje zien stekenIk trok het er uit en mompelde even kijken terwijl mijn
ogen reeds over dp cijfers vlogen Daarna lachte ik mijn van zor
gen bevrijde lach Ik wierp me in moeders arinenen wist van ge
luk niets anders te doen dan alsmaar laohen en juichen Daarna
gaf ik mijn ouders een arm en zo lie pen we huiswaarts En ik
lachte weer want vader fluisterde me veelbelovend in het oor
dat hij een verrassing voor me had

hopnan ons een leven gegeven Het leven is een stukje touw
dat je achter aan je riem draagt en als het tijdens het spel van
je afgenomen wordt ben je dood
De vlag van onze groep was al in de aarde geplant We moesten
hun vlag proberen te veroveren en de verkenners van de andere
groep die ook in de buurt kampeerdem moesten de onze bemachtigen
Plotseling hoorden we drie lange fluit stoten Eindelijk het sein
TIedereen op zijn plants riep de kampvuurleider Nauwelijks
waren we vertrokken of ik zag een donkere gedaante voortrennen
Frank probeerdo hem tegen te houden De aanvaller was hem echter
te viug af Hij rende in mijp righting Sneldook ik achter een
struik En toen hij langs mij been rende nan ik een sprong en
daar lagen we al boven op mekaar
Ik lag wel boven maar de slimmerik bleef op zijn rug liggen
eri ik kon hem niet TModenT want hoe ik ook probeerde om hem om
te draaien hij bleef als aan de grond vastgeplakt Gelukkig kwam
Frank aangekropen
ftNeem jij deze voor je rekening fluisterde ik
tGoedTT antwcordde hij en op een niet al te zachtzinnige manier
greep hij de gevangene vast en draaide hem om en rukte het stuk
je bliksemsnel weg
Geruisloos sloop ik ondertussen verder
Daar zag ik drie donkere figuren aankomen Dat is toch wel wat
te vteel voor mijTT dacht ik en drukte me plat tegen de grond
Ze zagen me niet en verder kroop ik voort
Toen ineens nog geen twintig meter verder zag ik de
vijandelijke vlag wapperen Nog voorzichtiger vervolgde ik mijnsept Eerste schooldag Iedereen begint weer vol goede moed

hagedis sloop ik geruisloos
verder
Ongelukklgerwijze werd
ik plotseling opgemerkt
Zo snol ik kon dook ik in
een kuil die ik ergens aan
mijn rechterkant had opge
merkt Doodstil bleef ik
hierin liggen
Ik hoorde de stemmen
van twee jongens
Hij moet hier in de buurt
zijn
En ze kwamen steeds dichtcr
bij
Toen klonk het hard De vlag wordt aangevallen kom vlug
we moeten onze vlag redden Laten we gauw gaan helpen
antwoordde de andere verkenner Sfeamen verdwenen ze
Verder sloop ik en ik zag hoe het gevecht plaats vond
Helaas werden onze aanvallers teruggeslagen en moesten vluchten
Dat is mijn kans dacht ik Ik passeerde de vijandelijke wacht
posten en al gauw lag ik vlak bij de lag Niemand had er iets
van gemerkt
Stevig hieId ik de verkennersstok waar de vlag aan vast
zat beet en trok uit alle macht toen rende ik zc hard ik kon
naar veilig gebied De twee wachters waren zo verschrokken dat
ze alleen maar verbaasd hadden staan toekijken
De vlag de vlag ze hebben de vlag gestolen hoorde ik nog
achter mij roepen Maar ik was al dicht bij ons eigen kampement

ARMANDO CURET AA hebben we in onze sportrubriek deze keer niet zo heel
veel nieuws voor sommige zal het be si st erg welkom zijn
vooral Toor onze Tbasketballers
Toen onze school vorig jaar een uitnodiging kreeg van
de BasketballBond cm mee te doen met de competitie hebben
we hieraan geen gehoor gegeven door allerlei omstandigheden
Dit jaar echter hoorden we al heel gauw geruchten van
een schoolbasketballteam Enkele tiendeklassers kwamen
op het idee en de trainingen zijn zelfs al in voile gang
De bedoe ling is nu om met een team mee te gaan spelen in
de Bklas En we moeten in puike conditie zijn als eenmaal
de competitie begint

SPRITZERFUHRMANN
Geachte Abonnees
Zoals U zult lezen bij het Journaal van LSC zat de redak
tie even in de put toen er op oktober geen copie was
Enige dagen later was er volop zodat we zelfs het een en ander
hebben moeten laten liggen voor de volgende maand oa een inter
essant verslag van het internaatsleven op Curaao van onze ex
redaktrice Amanda Arends
De reaktie van enkele trouwe lezeressen van het MC wordt
op bl afdoende beantwoord vermoed ik De reaktie leidt ons
blad stelt het samen en zorgt voor illustraties maar de artike
len moeten hoofdzakelijk kamen van onze abonnees van de leerlin
gen dus En we doen hierbij vooral een beroep op het La He Col
lege die in deze beslist te schuchterzijn
Stuur verder Uw pennevruchten in vr de de van de maand
anders wordt het te veel hurry hurry en daar leidt ons blad on
der De meeste redakteurs zitten in de de klas die zouden dan
op het einde van de maand een nadelig saldo krijgen wat hun pun
ten betreft
CD
Neen jeugdige lezertanderis geen nieuw ontdekt lichaams
deel teen en tanderis dialectisch Nederlands voort een en t
ander Dit artikeltje zal dus niet een doorlopend geheel vormen
met bijv de bekende driedeling inleiding eigenlijke onderwem
en het slot maar van alles en nog wat Een slimme lezer zegt
Dij zich zelf een teken dat de schrijver geen onderwerp kan
l f t een bijd heelt of geen tijd meent te hebben of iets
dergelijks Antwoord niet onmogelijk maar vergeet niet dat de
ici cr ook niet op commando kan dichten dat de componist even
min op commando kan dichten een nieuwe symphonie kan spelenof
zomaarten lied uit zijn mouw kan schudden en toch wensen de
redacteuren dat Wiet dat ik hun dat erg kwalijk neem een redak
teur van een tijdschriftje heeft altijd twee pijlen op zijn
boog hij schrijft zlf of hij vraagt een ander en in dat
laatste geval is er niet altijd de gewenste insniratie of zin
In het eerste nummer Van de derde jaargang stonden een naar
vragen en geen retorische vragen waarom dus niet een antwoord
geprobeerd
Vraag WAAROM KIEST IEMAND MULO MET WISKUNDE ALS ER OP
ARUBA ZOVEEL GEBREK AAN BOEKHOUDEN IS
Iemand kiest wiskunde en niet handel NIET omdat hij handel
een waardeloos vak vindt of omdat hij wiskunde zo leuk vindt
maar omdat het nu eenmaal NODIG IS wiskunde gehad te hebben om
op een andere school verder te kunnen mogen studeren
En heel veel jongens en meisjes willen die MOGELIJKHEID niet uit
s luiten En dat ze verder willenstuderen komt nog al eens voor
omdat ze toch nog geen werk kunnen vinden
Nu zou iemand kunnen vragen waarom niet bijv frans laten
vallen in klas en en dan handel EN wiskunde handhaven
Inderdaad een goed idee dat echter al eerder is besproken en
helaas practisch is afgewezen weer in verband met die mogelijk
heid voor ter dere studie waarbij frans vereist blijft dus
voor Kweekschool en HBS Dit is te meer wraar omdat bijna niemand
na de ste klas al definitief een studiekeuze meent te kunnendoenVraag
IS BOEKHOUDEN ALLEEN VOOR DE DOMMEN
Wat een vraag Die is zeker niet gesteld door iemand die
zelf van dit vak op de hoogte is Ze is dan ook zeker niet van de
heer Engelbarts zelf maar is hem blijkbaar door anderen gesteld
Dat iemand tot zon domme vraag is kunnen komen komt mogelij om
dat hij zij op de school gemerkt heeft dat iemand die moeilijk
leerde de handelsklas koos in plaats van de wiskundeklas en het
eenvoudige muloexamen tenminste het zogenaamde AP dat is alge
meen programma is zo gering dat om dat weinige handelsrekenen
te kennen men desnoods wel enigszins dom mag zijn
Maar l Om meer dan dat kleine beetje van dat vak te kennen zijn
hersens en vooral uithoudingsvermogen want zonder dat
zijn hersenen een dood kapitaal nodig Tussen haakjes juist om
dat het A P zo weinig geeft wordt het door iets zwaarders en veel
beters vervangen Maar omdat dit muloexamenhandel zo eenvoudig
is concluderen dat dus Boekhouden voor de dcmmen is is er in eik
geval helemaal naash
Ik heb wel eens pientere leerlingen gekend die toch de
handelsklas kozen en dan met prachtige cijfers slaagden ook
Toor de andere vakken omdat het bij hen vaststond dat ze niet
verder gingen shuderen
DE FOUT ZIT ECHTER HIERIN DAT MEN NA HET MULOEXAMEN VOOR DIT VAK
BOEKHOUDEN NIET VERDER GAAT Hierover zo dadelijkjneer
Efet feit dat er op Aruba geen
personen zijn die het Braktijkdi
ploma Boekhouden hier hebben gehaald
is wel een bewijs dat Boekhouden niet
voor de dcmmen is
GoekbQuffeo
VCXv J
Vraag
WAAROM IS ER ZO WEINIG ANIiS
M VOOR DEZE STUDIE be
doeld dus voor degenen die de mulo
verlaten hebben
Het antwoord kan zyn l De velen
die verder gaan studeren UTS HBS
Kweekschoolvallen meteen al uit e
daal zouden juist goede klanten bij zijn
Er IS wel animo ik heb een jaar gekend dat men met cursis
tenbegon voor Praktijkdiploma Boekhouden dus en na enkele
maanden bleven er geen over Waarom Omdat men niet de moed
had tw drie jaar deze studie vol te houden
Het is daarom een praktisch en realistisch idee van de Heer
vd Koppel geweest te starten met een Cursus Boekhouden I en
daarna Boekhouden II die elk slechts een half jaar duurden en
uitsluitend op de praktiek hier waren gericht
Dat is de manier een cursus van KORTERE duur zoals dat ook de
avondcursussen op de ATS doen
Beeft men deze twee cursussen met succes doorlopen dan heeft men
al iets breikt en bij menigeen is er dan wel de moed en de vol
hardende zin om ook het Praktijkdiploma aan te rakken om van
MB A nog maar niet te spreken
Helaas zijn deze cursussen opgehouden Het is te hopen dat
ze binnen afzienbare tijd weer terug zullen keren Ze waren ab
soluut niet alleen maar bestemd voor leerlingen die het handels
diplomabehaald hadden
Iemand die na de ste klas de handel vaarwel heeft gezegd omdat
hij nu eenmaal de wiskundeklas koos moet het dwaze vooroordeel
Tdat boekhouden voor de dommen zou zijn opzij zetten en kan na
zijn mulodiplorna met wiskunde zeker voor Boekhouden gaan stude
ren juist omdat de behoefte aan bekwame boekhouders groot is
Vraag KAN IK VERONDERSTELLEN DAT IEMAND MET EEN MULDIPLMA
ZELFSTANDIG VERDER KAN STUDEREN OF IS DIT TE VEEL
GEVRAAGD
De waarheid de ervaring heeft
dat uitgewezen is dat de meeste
leerlingen die tegenwoordig het
mulodiploma behalen niet zelf
standig kunnen verder studeren
Ze hebben een cursus nodig
Dit komt gedeeltelijk doordat het
mulosysteem uitleggen nogeens
uitleggen precies alles opgevencontroleren aansporen en aanporren het selfst studeren
niet ere bevordert Maar zu dlt allemaal niet ge beu e
dan zou door heel velen het mulodiploma niet behaald worden
Dit is niet algemeen waar er zijn leerlingen die garende
behandeingleren zelfstandig te werken maar wel voor een groot
percentage
Fven een opmerking om misverstand te voorkomen zelfstandig
stude reiis tegengestelde van ONDER LEIDING studeren en niet
tet tegenstelde van domweg van buiten leren ditste
mensonwaardig en zal op een gezonde mulo ook niet tot systeem
behoren Dat een of andere leerling het toch doet is zijn f
hr saak En een doodenkele keer aal Iedereen het eens mee
maken dat hij zegt Ik snap het wel niet ik zal het dan m
bewonderen en vanbuiten leren
Kt een andere opmerking Een Mulogeslaagde meent te gauw
ith tg cmdat hij in zekere zin namelijk van dit sc
Ce de top de Sddrbereikt heeft Kt is echter nog maar
een stao Hij zij moet begrijpen dat er verder gewerK m e
worden vroeger was dat mogelijk maar niet meer m onze tij
heeft menSpaans of Engels GEHD er valt nog genoeg baj te Ie
ren en er zijn nog zovele andere terreinen
Dit was dan het een Ifet S ecllde nifw
dat ik het hierbij laat Met iedereen zal het thetbven
staande helemaal eens kunnen zijn en vooral zullen mogelijk n g
belangrijke factoren of beschouwingen vergeten zijn

deur en vraag aan de verpleegster die open doet of ik jaar even
een paar vragen mag stellen
Ja hoor ik heb alle tijd voor je ga maar zitten
Zuster ik zie dat U een speldje op hebt wat betekent dat
Wel dat betekent dat ik gediplomeerd verpleegster ben en dus
wetteijkbeschermd
En dat ooievaartje wat betekent dat eigenlijk
Nou dat betekent dat ik kraam heb
Mag U dus ook bevallingen f Dooft
Nee daar moet men vroedvrouw of dokter voor wezen Ik mag al
leen de dokter assisteren bij een bevalling en moeder en kind
verzorgen
Kunt U nog meer aantekeneingen halen behalve kraam
Jazeker oa de kinderaantekening de wijk en het zwarte kruis
Het zwarte kruis
Ja een zwartekruisverpleegster is gespecialiseerd in het
verzorgen van geestelijk gestoorde patinten
Waar hebt U Uw opleiding gehad zuster hier op Aruba
Nee dat kon destijds niet Mijn opleiding heb ik in Nederland
gehad in twee verschillende ziekenhuizen in Zevenaar en Den Haag
Hoe lang duurt de opleiding
De opleiding voor het Adiploma
duurt drie jaar en dat heb ik
dus in Zevenaar behaald en dan
nog zes maanden kraamopleiding
in Den Haag
jNtSJYVW
jvwrWelke opleiding wordt er vereist
Minstens Mulodiploma maar men maakt ook wel eens uitzonderin
gen op deze regel
Houdt U van Uw beroep
Ja ik beschouw het meer als een roeping
Hoe bent U er toe gekomen om verpleegster te worden
Met mij is het heel gek gegaan Xk wilde n eerst medisch ana
liste worden Ik heb dan ook een tijdje in een laboratorium ge
werkt maar dat viel mij erg tegen Ik miste het contact met an
deren Daar ik veel vriendinnen had in de verpleging heb ik het
toen in de verpleging geprobeerd en tot nu toe heb ik er ecnt
geen spijt van gehad Ik kan mij geen mooier beroep voorstellen
dan het verpleegsterwerk
Waarin bestaat eigenlijk Uw werk zuster
Zoals je ziet werk ik op de Gezondheidsdienst als assistente
van de psychiater Ik doe ook huisbezoeken en breng de heel erg
gestoorden naar Curaao daar er hier geen inrichting rcor is
Vindt U dat niet erg
Wel nee want ze slapen onderweg en bovendien heb ik altijd een
politieagent bij me
U hebt wel een erg afwisselend werk zuster zoiets zou ij
beslist ook wel aantrekken Wie weet misschien worden we later
nog wel eens collegas
Wel zuster ik wil U verder niet van het werk afhouden
Heel hartelijk dank voor dit interessant gesprek en veel succes
met Uw mooi werk
Geen dank juffrouw en tot ziens

GEBREK IS AAN BOEKHOUDERS
a Omdat wiskunde voor sommigen misschien gemakkelijker is
dan boe knorden
b Omdat er ook velen zijn die denken dat wiskundige knapper
zijn Of dit waar is mag Joost weten
IS BOEKHOUDEN ALLEEN VOOR DE DOEMEN
Helemaal niet Als dat het geral was dan zou er op Aruba geen
gebrek zijn aan boekhouders
WAAROM IS ER ZO WEINIG ANIMO VOOR DEZE STUDIE
Misschien wel omdat het juist zo moeilijk is
KM IK VERONDERSTELLEN DAT IEMAND MET EEN MULODIPLOMA ZELF
STANDIG VERDER KAN STUDEREN OE IS DAT TE VEEL GEVRAAGD
Bij enkele vooral nog t jonge leerlingen kan dit wel te
veel gevraagd zijn
NOG ENKELE OEviERKINGEN
U met niet veronderstellen dat er op het Maria College de
meisjes alles wordt voorgekauwd om het alleen maar door
te slikken Daar vergist U zich ini
i
De keesten die op de Mulo Engelse les gekregen hebben zijn
daardoor niet in staat een vlot Engels gesprek te voeren
Later door veel oefenen kan het wel Uitzonderingen hierop
zijn natuurlijk die kinderen die thuis Engels spreken

OKTOBER J I jXJ A
Het was een grote vreugde voor het volk van Aruba dat Hm
de Koningin en ZKH Prins Bernard het met een bezoek vereerden
Men was enige weken tevoren al begonnen met het illumineren ran de
gouvernementsgebouwen en de Nederlandse en Antilliaanse vlaggen
werden uitgestoken Er werd ook een beroep gedaan op de winkeliers
om hun etalages te versieren
s Avonds zag je een heleboel mensen door de straten en langs
de boulevard rijden en wandelen om naar de verlichting te en
Het was allemaal schitterendVooral het Bestuurscollege en de uTil
lem III toren waren fantastisch
Ou oktober was ik al vroeg wakker en wekte mijn kleine broer
omdat hij zich snel moest aankleden om met de welpen naar het vlieg
veld te gaan Daar zouden ze voor de Koningin en de Prinsals ere
wacht fungeren Belaas koude de andere familieleden er met hem
gaan want mijn vader had de wachten moest thuisblijven Ik ging
met miin andere broers naar de stad om toch maar een g van
het Koninklijk Paar op te vangen Wij waren net bij La Esperanza
gekomen ten ze voorbij kwamen Ik vond dat de Koningin zowel
als de Prins er jonger uitzagen dan op de fotos Zij groetten de
mensen die langs de kant van de weg stonden waarop wij terug
wuifden on juichten
Wij gingen toen de Zeven Provincin bekijken Er waren vee
mensen
mensen Va r men mocht het schip pas s middags om uur bezichtigei
Daarna gingen we op stap naar het Postkantoor Daar stonden de
scholen netjes ongesteld terwijl ze net als wip op de kom
van het Koninkliik Paar wachtten Eindelijk kwamen ze aan De kin
deren met de vlaggetjes inde handen juichten de Koningin en e
Prins uitbundig toe terwijl wi met de handen zwaaiden net
KoMnklijk Paar verscheen even later met het gevolg en andere aan
wezigen op t balkon Frre Aloxius dirigeerde en de schoolkinde
ren zongen uit volle borst Op de dag dat zevertrokken hadden

De laatste twee weken wan het baseball seizoen waren de meest
glorieuze momenten voor de Dodgers Hoewel ze bijna heel het sei
zoen door aan de kop waren bleek het of ze hun ster Tommy Da vis
niet misten Het werk van Sandy Koufax Don Drysdale en Maury
Wills was formidabel Koufax won wedstrijden en Drysdale ein
digde met wedstrijden wat betekent dat ze samen meer dan de
helft van ie gewonnen wedstrijden wonnen Maury Wills was
altijd de leider in het offensief met batting average en
stal ook nog honken het hoogste aantal
In de American League was het ai voorspeld voor de All Star
game wie de uitblinkers waren De Minnesota Twins hadden zoals
de Dodgers bijna heel het seizoen door de leiding Dit was de
eerste pennant voor de Twins terwijl de Dodgers reeds meermalen
ennants behaalden
Om een triomfantslijk seizoen van de Dodgers te completeren
wonnen ze ook nog de ivorld Series in zeven wedstrijden Steunend
op Koufax behaalden ze de overwinning De ster verloor zijn
beginwedstrijd maar won daarna
twee wedstijdon een nfourhittern
in de vijfde wedstrijd en een
threehitterM in de laatste wed
strijd Allen dachten dat de Dod
gers met hun Pitchers en de Twins
mehun Batters zouden werken
maar de Dodgers kwamen tervoor
schijn met hun Pitching Hitting
en RunningBe eerste en tweede wedstrijd
kwinexx in handen van de Twins Vol
gens mijn bescheiden mening verlo
ren de Dodgers deze beide wedstrijd
den door de kou
Maar de Dodgers kwamen weer in
vorm in Las Angelus hun thuisbasis
waar zij dan ook dedrie volgende
wedstijden overtuigend wonnen
Vooral de hit and run van de Dodgers was groots in deze
wedstrijden In totaal werden er verder honken gestolen
In de vijfde wedstrijd was Koufax
zozeer in vorm dat hij op weg was een
no hitter tewerpen maar dit eindig
de in de vijfde inning toen Killebrew
de geweldige batter van de Twins een
basehit sloeg
Toen de stand was in het voor
deel van de Dodgers kwamen de Twins wee
in de race en wonnen de zesde wed
strijd J irci Grant was de eerste die twee
wedstrijden won in de Series toen hij
in deze wedstrijd een zege behaald
de In de laatste wedstrijd de zevende stelden de Dodgers air
hun hoop op hun ster pitcher Sandy Koufax De uitslag liet wel
bli ken dat hij de beste werper van onze tijd is Met een
zege en met slechts drie hits tegen werd hij uitgeroepen tot de
hero van de World Series en kreeg
daarbij een Corvette
Koufax verscheen in drie wedstrij
den en won er twee vanf Hij bezorgde
mannen een strike out gaf
vrije honken en stond slechts runs
toe beide unearned De beste batters
waren Maury Wil is met hits en ftn
Fairly ook waarvan homeruns

Een frjetTt dwars door de Nassaustraat alle meisjes kijken Daar

Op je bromfiets zit een klein plaatje meestal op het motor
blok Daar staat je motorncmmer op en het vermogen vn de motor
Meestal lees je  cc en H P Deze twee getallen ver
tellen je hoe sterk je motor is En datis echt geen klein beetjei
Een H P betekent een horsepower Hu moet je niet direct
denken aan een paard want tussen een oude knol een trek
paard en een racepaard is veel verschil in kracht
Een paardekracht is kilo en meter omhoog trekken in n se
conde Als je sterk bent kun jij dat ook wel maar je houdt dat
niet lang vol
Jouw bromfiets kan dat uren achter elkaar een geweldige
prestatie voor zofn klein motortje Maar hij doet het alleen als
je hem goed te eten geeft In je boekje staat olie
Geef je te weinig olie dan zet de zuiger te veel uit Het hart
van de motor wordt gloeiend heet en plotseling zit de zuiger dan
muurvast En je hebt dan nog geluk gehad Heel vaak breekt
er dan iets van binnen af
Maar t veel olie is ook verkeerd Ja het is wel leuk am
rookgrdijnen te leggen op de straat maar de meeste olie ver
brandt in de cylinder en de TtasTT ervaren rijders noemen dat
TTkoolTT gaat de uitgangen van het hart verstoppenGeef je nu vol gas dan helpt dat weinig ffet gas kan maar lang
zaam in de cylinder komen door die verstopte gaten Je hebt nu
geen P K onder je zadel maar slechts een H P
Sommige jongens menen dat ze de geluidsbarrire moeten door
breken Ze gaan prutsen aan de uitlaatpijp Binnen in die prach
tig glanzende pijp zit nog een pijp met heel Teel gaatjes Haal
die er maar uit dan heb je geen claxon meer nodig
Maar je H P vliegen vlug wegJ Je laat je paarden
los zonder dat ze eerst voor je werken ffet gas inde cylinder
aarzelt geen ogenblikj
Binnen in de cylinder is het zo heetJ er uitJ zo gauw
mogelijk er uitfc voor dat de sparkplug komt met zijn vonk
De weg is immers vrij nu de uitlaatbuis zo lekker ruim is ge
worden
Je ziet dus wel dat de uitlaat nog wel iets meer doet dan
alleen het gelid smoren
Wil je veel plezier van je bromfiets hebben dan moet hij
op tijd in de fTserviceM Dat kun je ook zelf doen

Mhr Pieters LSCBij het woord tTinternaatf of TTkostschoolff krijgen veel mensen
vooral de jonge vrijheidslievende generatie visioenen vsen donkere
gevangenissen drukkende strengheid brood als maaltijd en water
als nagerecht  Nee zo erg is ht er niet de internen
zien echt wel de zon overdag wij kennen echt wel de hoofdstraten
van de fTwereldstadff Willemstad hoewel het helemaal niet zo
als thuis is je Home sveet home nee je mag niet zomaar
in en uit je chambrette het gat nogal Frans hier h wippen
hardop zingen tijdens het baden staat gelijk metmoord
Voor degenen die horen tot de overbevolkte groep der kletskousen
is d it leven in het begin zeer moeilijkik ho r er ook bij hoor
tot mijn grote schande Een geluk nog dat je bij het eten wel
je mond open mag doen behalve dan voor het happen In de studie
klas en op de slaapzaal moet er eigenlijk absolute stilte heei
sen Maar aangezien Ttkletsenff een aangeboren eigenschap is van
meis jes
Ts Morgens word je uit je zoete dromen gehaald door een ffaller
liefst luidendff belletje het meest gehate voorwerp in het inter
naat Het arme ding machteloos liggend op de trap wordt iedere
morgen naar alle mogelijke plaatsen verwenst het wordt iedere
morgen aangevallen door meer dan vijftig vuurspuwende blikken
Nee zijn vriendje in de refter leidt een veel beter leven die
wordt veel eerder hartelijk begroet
Qm ongeveer kwart voor acht zeggen wij het internaat vaarwel en
sjouwen met een prppvolle schooltas naar de school die zich naast
het klooster en het Maria Collegej bevindt Daar worden vij op
geslokt tot tien voor n
De middagen worden heel fTgezelligfT doorgebracht in de studieklas
met uitzondering van dinsdag en donderdag dan mogen wij zowaar
een sista houden van tot En op zatef dagmiddag gaan w met
zijn allen in een bus van het jaar nul naar fTBlauwff een nogl
behoorlijke fTbeachff waar wij het strand de hel middag pnveilig
make nOok als Het Vrij weekendrT is tweede week van de iriaand
worden de thuisblijfsters met dit itje vervnd Het zijn heus
geen stakkers deze thuisblijfsters aangezien op dit bewuste
Vireekend alle regels wegsmelten het belletje krijgt wat rust en
de teugels zijn minder strak
Verder is het internaat in bezitvan en radio pickup zon
moderne zez je moet het zelf opwinden en een echte TV
Donderdaga ond mogen wij naar de beroemde TTShindigrr kijken als
we tenminste de hele week braaf zijn geweest en soms worden wij
or TTBewitchedTT of TShow de RennyTT getrakteerd het hangt dik
wijls af van de temperatuur van de stemming der meerderen
Wee als je ht t fToed bekijkt valt dit leven heus wel mee
wij hebben dikivijls erg vel pret

Niet alleen bij de jeugd de teenagersy maar ook bij de anderen
Als er iots slochts gessegd uordt over de Beatles nou dan
vcrzeker ik jullio dat ik ze wel zal verdedigen
Waarom Nou heel geinakkelijk
De Beatles hebben namenlijk iets heel groots gepresteerd wat veel
filmsterren in al hun jaren niet gemakkelijk gedaan zouden hebben
De Beatles hebben in zeer korte tijd de jeugd aangewakkerd Nau
welijks horen zij een plaat van de Beatles of ze schreeuwen mee
en maken de gekste figuren wat ze dansen noemen
Sinds de Beatlesplaten op de markt zijn hebben heel wat
jongens hun kaar een ietsje langer en dragen veel meer jeans dan
vroeger
ij meisjes hebben nu geen permanent meer maar laten ons
haar sluik hangen
Als we nu de beroemde Beethoven bekijken zien we dat hij
heus niet zofn grote groep mensen geenthousiasmeerd heeftRed
Maar ofschoon de Beatles veel voor hun succes overhebben hebben
ze natuurlijk wl tijd om naar meisjes uit te kijken
Zodoende zijn er al drie getrouwd ende laatste Paul blijft
ook niet achter en zal binnenkort trouwen
Wel is het heel rg jammer dat volgens het laatste TTtiener
nieuwsTt Paul als hij trouwt niet meer bij het kwartet zal blijven
Ja er valt niets te treuren en laten we allen hopen dat er
in zijn plaats ook een heel goede en flinke Beatle zal komen

Zijn eigenlijke naam is LOU LICHTVELD Hij werd in  te
Paramaribo geboren Zijn vader was gouvernementsambtenaar Als
kind al bleek Lou bijzonder muzikaal begaafd te zijn
Zijn eerste muzieklessen kreeg hij van een vriend van zijn vadder

hier koorknaap en toen de fmilie na enkele maapden weer terug
keerden naar Suriname bleef Lou achter Hij ging studeren op
het seminarie te Roermond hij wilde namelijk gen musicus wor
den maar priester
De kleine Lou kon echterhiet zo goed tegen het Nederlandse
klimaat en was zodoende vaak ziek Bovendien bleek hij geen vol
doende aanleg te hebben voor priester Na twe en en half jaar
verliet hij het seminarie en keerde terug naar Paramribo
In was hij echter wer terug ln lederland in Amster

DECEMBER PRIES TERZATERDAG J
Onze Antilliaanse Priesterstudenten rekenen op ons gebed
en od onze maandelijkse bijdrage Denken jullie daraan
OoooooooooooooooVfeten jullie wie Zolli is Nu dan zal ik het jullie Tertellen
Zolli is een heel verlegen jongen Hij is nogal arrn Hij
loopt met een gelapte broek en kapotte schoenen Altijd ziet hij
er vuil uit Zijn haren zijn steeds wir war door elkaar Eigen
lijk heet hij niet zo maar hij kreeg die naam omdat hij een
echte Zolli was
Nu ga ik eigenlijk de geschiedenis vertellen Nou Zolli
had eens een meisje en wou haar een serenade geven flet was op
een zondag Toen het nsucn sucuTT begon te worden vertrokken
Zolli en zijn vrienden Ja zei hij ze slapen al Zolli en zijn
vrienden begonnen te zingen en gitaar te spelen Nauwelijks
stondn ze een minuut te zingen of de deur ging oen Zolli zei
Nu korit ze Ze komt luisteren vvet je het zeker vroegen zijn
vrienden Ja ze i Zolli ze komt naar ons luisteren
Maar arme Zolli flet was de vader van zijn vriendinnetje die
met een TTcarbachiT in de hand aankwam Net toen Zolli weer
een ander lied wilde inzetten stond de woedende vader voor hem
En zelfs niet allen de verontvaardigde vader maar ook nog en
kele potige broers  de carbachi begon te TregenentT
Zolli en zijn vrienden kozen zo snel ze konden het hazenpad
Van die dag af heeft Zolli nooit meer aan TTserenadesTT gedachto
Zijn vrienden hadden hem ook nog eventjes onderhanden geno
men Alsof die carbachi nog niet genoeg was geweestJ
Van toen af noemde hem iedereen TfZolliTT
TTKaentje bij de kapperTT
M ODUBER C MC
De kapper fTEn hoe wil je dat ik je haren knipT
Koentje TTAsjeblief hetzelfde als vader met een open plek in
het midden TTIn dit derda nuimner van onze nBao di Kwihin zal ik ook eens
iets naar voren brengen Het heeft iets te maken met de vragen
die beantword werden door fr Arnoldr ht gaat dus over Boek
houdene Toen ik in de achtste klas zat kregen we handel n
viskunde Aan het eind van dat schooljaar moesten we kiezen
Er waren drie achtste klassen met ngeveer leerlingenf hiervan
kozen er de iskundeklas als zij tenminste over zouden gn
Z kwameri er dus slechts jongens in de handlsklasJ
Dit komt volgens mij doordat fr Arnold het hele jaar door
bleef zeggen nDenk erom jongens als je de handelsklas kiest
dan kun je daarna niet verder studerenTT Wel ditwas waar
dit is waar dit zal waar blijven maar toch vind ik dit niet fn
reden om de jongens van de ste klassensfceeds maar te blijven zeg
gen TTAls je de handelsklas kiest kun je niet verder studerenT
Hierdoor komt het dat zo weinig jongens de handelsklas kiezen
Ik noem dit een soort TTpropagandaTT voor de xviskundeklas
Ikzelf heb de handelsklas gekozen Enkele keren heeft Frre
Arnold me gevraagd of ik er geen spijt van had Nu ik kan eer
lijk zeggen TIk heb er beslist geen spijt vanTT Dit jaar zijn
er slechts jongens die handel doen c En het gaat zeer
goed  e ffet voorgaande is niet bedoeld als kritiek op frre r
nold ffet is alleen maar mijn mening dat dit de reden is dat er
zo weinig jongens hsndel en boekhouden kiezen
Maar nu volgt wel een kr it iek  a In het vorige nummer stond
op bladz bij TTfeaktieTT het volgende
Vr Is boekhouden alleen voor de dommen Antw ffelemaal niet
als dat het geval was zou er geen gebrek zijn aan boekhoudersJ
Ik kan onmogelijk geloven dat een Arubanse jongen meisje
dit geschreven kan hebben want hieruit volgt immers dt er op
Aruba heel veel dcmme mensen zijn Dit is een bledigihgJ
Enkele jongens die hier op Aruba werkloos rondlopen hebben
wel een diploma maar kunnen geen werk krijgen veel anderen zijn
niet d o m maar wel u i om te leren Goed er zijn natuur
lijk ook zeker domme mensen op Aruba maar dan hoeft zofn vraag
toch nog niet zo opgelost te worden Als ik ongelijk heb kun
je gerust fn antwoord sturen  TTlVlULTATULLn c L SC
ErvaringJ  o Iets schrijven over mijn
ervaringi Mijn ervaring in de kleuterklas
Q jeetje hoe moet ik nou beginnen Ik zit pas
tviree maanden in de kleuterkls en veel erva
ring heb ik dus nog niet
Maar ja ik wil er toch wel het een en ander van vertellen
Hoeik op het idee kwam om bij de kleuters te gaan werken Wel
dat kwam zo ik hoordetoevallig iemnd er over nraten vond het
werk ineens interessant nam een besluit en hier sta ik nu voor
een heleboel sqhattige gezichtjes
Jullie zullen misschien verwonderd zijn hoe ik het aan kan
met zofn veertigtal pratende kinderen voor me Maar geloof me
het zijn heus geen babbelkousen die als de onderwijzer met de
les bezig is nog even met deburen een TftheeuurtjeTT houden het
zijn niet van die lui die bij de tweede bel de bal nog een flinke
duw of trap moeten geven nee bij de kleuters heeft men geen bel
nodig men hoeft niet eens een keer te bellen laat staan twee
Je kijkt ze slechts aan en ze zijn stil
Bij de kleuters komt het noo it voor dat onder het tekenen
er eentje zegt TIk kan het niet Je vertelt ze bijv een
verhaaltje van een oud vrouvrbje en een poes als je hen dan even
later een tekenblaadje geeft zullen ze na tien minuten allemaal
iets er op hebben staan Maar probeer dit nu eens bij de groten
de helft zal er niets maar dan ook niets op hebben staan Dit is
niet bedoeld als kritiek maar dit is om jullie er op te wijzen
waarom ik deze richting gekozen heb
Je moeh bij de kleintjes wel goed opletten als je hen iets
vertelt want owee als je iets verkeerd zegt of als ze je niet
goed begrepen hebben  Het gebeurde laatst nog dat een juf
frouv de kleuters vertelde over Adam en Eva want godsdientleskrijgen ze ook dat die dam en Eva een
appel hadden gegeten en toen niet
meer in het Paradijs mochten blijven
Een ventje dat niet zo erg goed had
opgelet en het dus niet goed begrepen had
ging naar huis en weigerde zijn appel
tje te eten
Na veel gevraag biechtte het jongentje
het bij zijn ouders ops TIk eet nooit geen
appels meer anders mag ik het Paradijs
niet in TT
Zo zien jullie dus dat het bij de kleintjes ook niet
altijd een gemakkelijk levent je is Je moet je werk met aandacht
en vooral met liefde doen anders slaag je er niet in
Trouwens is het niet zo dat er zonder liefde nergens
in de wereld iets goeds gedaan of bereikt kan worden

HOPI HENDELaatst stolde iemand voor eens een kritiek in te sturen
om de jongens van het L S C aan te wakkeren ook eens wat te
schrijven voor hun en ons blad want het is een feit dat ze met
maar weinig artikels voor de dag komen in Bau di Kwihi Ik weet
niet hoe het kwam maar opeens kreeg ik er ztn in
Iiier zit ik dan met een leeg papier voor me TTkritiek tegen
de jongens omdat ze niet eens even de tijd kunnen nemen om
hun stem ook eens te laten horen in BodK Zeg eens jongens ons
blad is er toch niet alleen voor de meisjes maar ook voor jul
lie dfW z julli kunneh en zijn zelfs verplicht ook regelmatig
in het blad te schrijven Vrda het Iviaria College erbij kwam

huiswerk Troost je maar w i j krijgen net zo veel als
jullie en misschien zelfs veel meer dus daarvan niet ge
sproken Wij zijn toch ook altijd bereid iets te schrijven en
we zullen dat blijven volhouden
Kom nou TTlaga flchep un banda stop du trasteriaT Ik ge
loof niet dat jullie echt niets wetei te schrijven Met een beet
je goede wil komen er vap jullie oojr prachtige artikels die wij
heel graag zullen lezene zitteher op te wachtenJ
Jullie kennen toch okhet spreekvoord nWaar een wil is
is een wegTt dus begin maar hjWlnen van die wegot en
dan profiteren we er allemaal vanLaat je hersens maar eens werken klim in je pen dan is er

dan toch wel op een fabriek Yroeger ging hij te voet naar zijn
werk  hij kan nou eenmaal geen auto besturen vergist zich tus
sen rem en gaspedaal en van de versnelling is hij bang De vijf
de en laatste die hem rijles gaf had nog als advies TTRaak astu
blief geen autoTs meer aanJTr Maar door de zon lonen vindt hij na
tuurlijk ook vreselijk en dasjrom rijdt hij nu met een vriendelij
ke kennis mee in een superdeluxe wagen
Niet lang geleden zei zijn zoon tegen me dat hij ook al aan
het sparen was voor een T V Ja hij was al bijna uitgespaard
Onze buurman spaart n altijd voor iets nieuws want hij wil
perse geen schuldeno
Op een middag zat hij rustig bij de radio te luisteren Wel
deze radio zit blijkbaar vastgeroest on Vidtoria want geen an
der station dringt hier binnen Met zijn allen zingen ze dan soms
mee vooral b ij de heel treurige liedjes dan lijkt het wel een
dodewake Ook voor zijn pickup heeft ie zijn soeciale plaatjes
Eentje van die platen is gewoon grijs van ouderdom ja ik zou
gaan vertellen over zijn radio
Als hij de radio weereens wil
aanzetten komt er niks zijn fa
voriete muziek klinkt niet op uit het
kastje De volumeknop gaat helemaal
naar rechts maar nog niks
Als hij hem laat repareren dan
komen er schulden nee dat in geen
geval En zo moet hij wachten tot
dat ie TfgecobreerdTf heeft Ja hoor
die zaterdagmiddag komt er iernand
die het euvel zal verhelpenAls de reparateur binnenkomt hoort hij mompelens MIk hoop dat je
hem weer gauv in orde hebt want ik kan mijn favoriete program
mafs niet missen en in zichzelf denkt de buurmans als het maar
te veel gaat kosten anders moet ilc schulden gaan maken
De reparateur echter heeft moeite om zijn lachen in te hou
den want hij merkt het rneteen de plug zit niet in het stopcon
tact maar ja hij moet toch iets verdienen nietwaar
Hij steekt de plug er dus niet in en doet alsof het de moeilijk
ste reparatie van ajn leven is hij draait aan alles waaraan maar
te draaien is snuffelt in de radio schroeft hem open en haalt
zijn ingewandenfT er een voor een uit terwijl hij alsmaar mom
pelt tTplenty work plenty workTT
Hven later gaat hij zelfs zijn baas opbellen om hem mee te
delen dat hij nog een paar uur TfovertimeM moet werken
TTDat zal weleen gepeperde rekening wordent denkt de arme
buurman als hij eindelijk ziet dat de spullen er weer een voor
een in gaan wat hij echter niet gezien heeft is dat de repara
teur in een onbewaakt ogenblik gauw de plug in het stopcontact
gestoken heeft
Eindelijk hetis ondertussen al dohker geworden is al les
klaar en kan het toestel geprobeerd worden
Toevallig staat het op een ander station en ineens schet
tert het door het huis TTI canTt get no satisfact ionT
De buren schuiven de gordijnen open verbaasd over die mu
ziek die nu uit de radio komt wat zou er nu toch met hen ge
beurd zijn Maar daar is reeds onze brave buurman naar het toe
stel gesneld en zoekt zljn station nIk houd niet van d eze plaat
zegt hij verontschuldigend
TTHet is anders de TTtophitTT wist je dat nog nietTT vraagt
de ander verbaasd terwijl hij de rekening schrijft en daarna af
geeft Met bevende handen wordt die in ontvangst genomen het
bedrag is vreselijk hoog veel hoger dan het beseheiden sommetje
dat hij momenteel in zijn portemonnaie heeft zitten

Er was eens een arme vdssers
vrouw waarvan de rnan was gestor
ven Zij had en dochtertje Ze woonden dicht bij de zee Haar
rug wras kroin geworden van verdriet en het moeilijke verk na de
dood van haar mario Dag en nacht werkte ze voor haar kindo Ze
hield er zielsveel van het deed haar denken aan haar gestorven
man Voor geen geld van de wereld zou ze haar willen missen
Iedere dag ging ze naar de zee om de kleren met zeewater te
wassen er vas toen nog geen waterleiding en ze had geen geld om
water te kopen Haar dochtertje wachtte elke dag met angst op de
torgkomst van haar moeder ze was bang van de zee de zee was
vals de zee had haar vador gegrepen en meegesleurd c
Op zekere dag wachtte het meisje tevergeefs  uren gingen
voorbij en nog washaar moeder niet teruggekomen Toen besloot ze
haan te cgaan zoeken Eerst dwaalde ze dor de duinen en riep tel
kensoMoederban kwam ze aan het strands ook niets Haar o
gen tuurden over de grote grijze golven
Zag zij daar iets Nee ze vergiste zichJ Ofwat was dat
daar ginds Vias dat niet de witte hoofddoek van haar moeder
en waar was moeder dan toch Verder op het strand zag ze
een paar mannen staan ook turend over de golven naar een zielig
klein bootje in de verte Een van deze mannen vertelde haar dat
haar moeder meegesleurd was door de golven en dat die mannen in
het bootje haar aan het zoeken waren
Uren en uren gingen voorbij toen langzaam het bootje te
rug kwam enkele vermoeide mannen starten er uit Langzaam ging
n van hen naar het bedroefde meisje toe Stotterend vertelde
hij het meisje TJe moedsr is c naar een  ver land gegaan
heel ver heel ver en heel mooieTT
Met grote tranerf ifi haar ogen keek ze in de boot daar was
moedrer niet dHs ws ze niet mee terug gekomen Maar waarom
was moeder tooh vah haar weg kunnenJgaan De grote golven

Maandag oktober om half negenstapten we de Lasallia
nen de en lOde klassers naar het Cultureel Centrum om van on
ze tweede oor de negende klaasers de eerste culturele voor
stelling te genieten
Iedereen genoot geweldig van het spel en van de muziek uit
een IiaLiaanse Opera Vier bedrijven lang zaten we vol gespannen
aandacht te kijken en te luisteren
Na afloop trokken er enige redaktieleden op uit voor een in
terview met deze artisten
Meneer Brugman kunt U ons zeggen wanneer dit Marionetten
theater werd opgericht
Wel dat gebeurde in door mijn vader met enige mede
werkers
Maar moest U een aparte studie volgen of had U er aanleg
voor want zo erg gemakkelijk lijkt me dit heus niet
Nee ik heb geen aparte studie
moeten volgen wij zijn er van
kleins af in opgegroeid We hielpen
Vader zo vaak zodat we de kuhst
ook leerden
Wel kregen we natuurlijk een
muzikale opleiding speciaal in de
richting TTOprette en OperamuziekT
Hoe wordt deze kunst nu eigen
lijk genoemdWel ik zou zo zeggen tMarionettenkunst maar ik denk dat
dit woord zo langzamerhand in het Ifederlands in onbruik is ge
raakt
Hebt U mensen die U helpen
Jazeker we zijn met zijn vieren hier oo ruba rnaar er zijn
ook enkele medewerkers in Mederland gebleven
Hebt U dit bewegingssysteem zelf uitgevonden
Ja toen dit theater door rnijn vader ongericht was gebruik
ten we nog draadmarionetten maar in de oorlogsjaren was het ver
verrg moeilijk en we gingen met handroppen werken
Kunt U ons nop iets vertellon over de decors
Uie zijn in drie dimenties zoals je hier kunt zien ze zijn
van een lichte stof pemaakt maar in Nederland Yrerken we met veel
zwaardere decors
Hoe vond U de sfeer hier in de zaal
Eerlijk gezgU veel beter dan bij de voorstelling opSan
Nicolaas het lijkt dat de leerlingen hier rneer gecultiveerd zijn
Bent U nu op tournee en hoeveel voorstellingen geeft
U zo ongeveer per jaar
Ja we waren een week op Curagao hier geven we opvoeringen
en dan gaan we naar Bonaire Saba St Eustatius Venezuela en
Trimiad tegen Kerstmis zijnwe veer in federland
We vinden het eiland heerlijk vooral Basirutfe waar we lo
geren en we hebben alles volop bekeken ja we geven ongeveer
voorstellingen per jaar waar ongeveer mensen naar ko
men kijken ook zijn we opgetreden in het Ufeninhlijk Paleis
Het is oktober uur In de Esso Club tc crc Colorado
vordt de tweede vergadering van de UNon doox Prsident Mijn
Ixeer Bezems geopend
Ilet ee rste voorstel wordt ingediend Prankrijk zict de ze
tel van de UHO graag verplaatst naar GenSve Na langdurige en
zelfs heftige debatten komt de beurt aan de YS zelfDe dele
gatie wijst erop dat na de tweode wereldoorlog unaniem besloten
werd de zetol te Hew York te plaatsen De delegatie van de YS
beschouwt het voorstel als een motie vanwantrouwen on is abso
luu t tegen stemining Als hieraan geon a andacht wordt geschon
ken v erlaat de delegatio de zaal
Do stemming ga at door maar het voorstel wordt vencorpene
Hicma volgt de pauze en wo voelen al aan dat zckor niet alle
drie de voorstcllen bohandeld zullen lcunnen vrorden
Het twecde voorstel van do a vond vordt door Japan MC
godaans Hct graven van een nieuy Kanaal doo r Coloinbia ipVc
het PanSvim ka naal Ua stemming aangenomen en weer volgen de
debatten waarbij de delegatio van do VS weer behoorlijk lang
van stof is en met kaarten te voorschijn komt waarop de mogelij
ke plaatson voor zon kanaal Rusland biedt zelfs aan om alles
te bekostigen a ls het kanaal ondcr Russisch beheer komt
Bij dc eindstcmming echter ordt ook deze motie vemorpen

Met begerige ogen kijkt hij door de winkelruiten
naar binnen Maar hij weet wel dat niets van al het
moois dat hij ziet zijn deel kan worden Alle mensen
die hij op straat ontmoet zijn blij en vrolijk niemand
schenkt aandacht aan de sjofel geklede ongen die hon
gerig en verkleumd door de straten zwerft
Nee hij heeft niets niets in deze vereld Vader
noch moeder heeft hij gekend en de oude vrouyr die
hem opgevoed heeft is enige tijd geleden gestorven
en zo is hij nu aan zijn lot overgelaten Het enige
waar hij meestal aan moet denken is hoe hij zijn
honger zal stillen
wordt nu al laat veel lichten zijn al uit
r gegaan ifet jongetje is op het grote kerkplein aan
gekomen waar hij rond blijft slenteren Vroege kerk
gangers lopen vlug naar binnen Hij zou ook wel de
kork binnengegaan zijn Maar hij durft niet want hij
heeft alleen wat vodden om zijn lijf Hij gaat in
een hoek bij de grote deur zitten in de sneeuw Hij
luistert naar hetgelui van de klokken en naar de
zachte tonen van het orgel Hn daarna slaapt hij in
rj Brr Wat is het koud weer bromt een agent
terwijl hij met de handen op zijn ru over het kerkplein
wandelt In deze nacht moet ik surveilleren Hij komt f
bij de kerkdeur kijlfb naar binnen naar het altaar eei
biedig maakt hij een kruisteken dan loopt hij verder
at lipt dar voer rommel bij de kerk op Kerstmis eeh

Hij schopt er tegen en tot zijn verbazing bewegen de
pet de schoenen en de sneeuwmassa zich laperig wrijft
een halfbevroren jongen zich de ogen uit iiat doeje
hier jongen vraagt de man je bent zeker een straot
jongen zonder huis en ouders Kom met me mee naar het
bureau
Daar aangekomen geeft hij de jongen een kop hete koffie
en eenplak koek Daarna vertelt de jongen hem wie hij is
en de agent krijgt medelijden met hem Hij vervent hem
en gooit een oude deken over hem heen als hij weer in
slaapt

et is Kerstnacht In de straten hangt oen vredige
stilte Toch is er niet in alle harten vrede In een
nikdonkere kamer staart een verbitterd man naar het
plafond Deze Yeek heeft hij een heftige ruzie met zijn
zoon Robert gehad over hetwel of niet gaan naar de
Kerk in de Kerstnacht s Zondags ging hij reeds lang
niet meer Toe vscder had zijn zoon gesmeekt Ik
wil het zo graag U moet niet zo verbitterd zijn God
heeft gewild dat
ilou op had hij geschreuuvd en hij had zijn zoon
naar zijn kamer gestuurd
Ru woelt hij van de ene zijde op de andere on kan
de slaa maar niet vatten Kan Robert niet begrijpen
dat hij zich nog niet kan verzoenen met Gods wil
Het vorig jaar rukte Hij tijdens een verschrikkelijk
ongeluk zijn lieve vrouv en drie kindertjes van hem
weg Moet hij nu blij zijn dat hij en zijn
l jarig zoon Robert gespaard bleveno
Hij is moe doodmoe wil niet meer denken Hij
wil slapeno slapen slapen
Bet liikt hem niet De herinneringen bestormen hem
en hij kan zich niet verweren Het zweet gutst hem
op het voorhoofd Dan staat hij op om zijn gloeiend
hoofd te laten afkoelen In het voorbijgaan valt
zijn oog op het portret van zijn overleden vrouw
die tijdens haar leven zeer godsdienstig Yas Hij
staat stil en mompelt terwijl de tranen hem over
de Yirangen stromen Vergeef mij ik kan het niet
nog niet nog niet

Hij laat zich zwaar op zijn bed vallen en weer
hoort hij ijn zoon zegaen Toe vader ik wil het
zo graag
Een klop op de deur en zijn zoon stat in de deur
opening Ben je klaar paps fluistert hij Hij is
gekleed en vel Klaar om de Nachtmis bij te wonen
Nog aarzelt zijn vader dan staat hij plotseling
vermoeid op Ga maar vast naar beneden Rob ik ben
zo klaar Hij ziet de ogen van zijn jongen oplichten
en het volgend ogenblik omhelzen vader en zoon el
kaar
Een half uur later zijn ze op weg naar de Kerk

Ze zag dat iedereen geluklcig vas en waarom zij niet Hat

Toen hoorde ze iemand voor haar stilstaan door haar tranen

keek ze op en een dame met een heel vriendelijk gezicht
koog zich over haar heen
Met horten on stoten vertelde het meisje haar droevig vor

Hopend dat jullie allemaal prettige Kerstdagen gehad
hebben kom ik nu met een artike over Lucha Libre waar
van ik niet wist dat dat ook op Aruba bestond Ja hoor
eohte Lucha Libre hier op Aruba
Op zekere woensdag ging cm uur de laatste bel op
school Alle jongens stomden de klassen uit de speel
plaats over en dan full soeed in de richting van de huis
houdschool Ik vroeg aan vroeg aan eentje die niet al te
snel was Viat is er toch aan de hand Hij antwoordde al
leen maar Schiet on anders missen we het gevecht
Qm alles procies te ieten stapte ik naar de promoter
van het gevecht een zeer dikke jongen en die vertelde me
in het kort De twee veohters zijn Piet Bagagedrager en
Jantje om de hoek Referee Jan van de Baan en het enige
jurylid fr Paulus De afspraak was om uur stirt
maar daar Fr Paulus dat toen nog niet wist kwam die na
tuurlijk te laat meegesleurd door de grote stroom jonens
die ergens heen gingen
Nu zou ik eigenlijk het gevecht moeten gaan vertellen
maar de meisjes interesseert het toch niet en de jongens
waren er allemaal aanwezig dus ik laat het bij de uitslag
Referee scoorde  fr Paul us scoorde  en
ALLLBEI konden de volgende morgen hun PRIJ gaan afhalen bij
fr Arnold
MULTATULI C L S C
En dan was er nog die jongeman die tegen zijn huilen
de geliefde zei Kom kom poesje als je vader niet wil
dat ik met je trouw dan vind ik heus wel een ander meisje
hoor dus huil nu maar niet meer

oooo
ooooOngeveer a jaar eeleden bestond er een tijd
schrift DE LASSO voor de leden van de verschilLnde jeugd
verenigingen van de Freres Mevr LAURA iERNETPASKEL zou
enige verhalen schrijven over het Aruba van vroeger de
ze verhalen heeft zij geschreven en het is heerlijk te le
zen over de oude tijd die wij ons niet meer kunnen voor
stellen Jaimner genoeg bestond ondertussen het tijdschrift
de Lasso niet meer en zijn die verhalen blijven liggen
Enige jaren geleden stierf Laura TTemet en deze vrien
delijke en achieve onderwijzeres werd vooral od Santa Cruz
zeer betreurd A kan zij ze ze If niet meer lezen en kun
nen wij er haar niet meer voor bedanken zullen we deze
verhalen uit de vergetelheid halen om ze te laten lezen
door de Arubaanse jeugd waarvoor zij ze geschreven heeft

Maar toch voelen wij ons groot en machtig en voornaam
en weten niet hoe ons e iland er uit zag jaar of zelfs
of jaar geleden a
Als grootvader bij ons op bezoek kwam en wij kregen
hem zover dat hij iets begon te vertellen dan begon hij
altijd In die goede oude tijd toen L Heer zich nog
indachtig was dat Aruba bestond regende het erg veel
Overal in het wild groeiden bonen pcmpoenen vatermeloe
nen en allerlei veldgewassen Het eiland was dichtbegroeid
en koeien en geiten konden overal grazen naar hartelust
fen at zich een eeuw oud wanterwas voedsel genoeg zie
maar eens hoe oud wij worden wij kunnen niet eens dood
gaan en dan gaven ive mekaar een duvtje maar die roiiimel
die jullie tegenwoordig eten durven jullie dat nog de naam
voedsel te geven bahJ
En als grootvader dit gezegd had vms hij zc veront
waardigd over de moderne tijd dah hij ophield meh vertellen
Ach groohvader ik wou dah OoLoHeor je nu de pemiissie zou
geven om je ondergrondse woning voor een paar uur te verla

Als de rooi heel hoog was ging vader mee vant dan was de
stroom te woest we plonsden en piaster en deden alsof het
dreigende spook van het planter niet boven ons hing

Als er een stelletje Hollanders bij elkaar staan dan
zie je meteen dat het Hollanders zijn hetzelfde bij Ameri
kanen Engelsen etc klaar wijs mij eens waaraan wij ruheinen
meteen te herkennen zijn wijs me eens het type van een
volbloed Arubaan dat kun je niet al zoek je ook van de mor

Kijk in je klas maar eens rend je ziet alle mogelijke

en donkere ogen kiiken je aan sommigen pronken met een
prachtige rechte neus anderen bezitten een stoma exemplaar
de ene heeft zcn formidabele voorgevel dat er nauwelijks
plaats overblijft Toor ogen of mond een ander heeft weer
een lief klein neusje waar hij hij of zij fier op gaat
Een Anerikaan die bij de Lago kwam werken had gauw ge
noeg door wie de Venezolanen Poetugezen Nederlanders enz
waren maar steeds kwam hij mensen tegen die hij niet kon
thuisbrengen en vroeg Wat is die man daar dan en kreeg
steevast als antwoord Dat is een Arubaan
Wel vend vloekte hij dan op zijn Amerikaans die man is
een Arubaan die daar ook verderop nog een die van giste

de melancholie van de heimwee
Bijvo dit gedeelte uit ZUID ZUID vEST
Door zulke wouden en langs onbegaanbare wegen wagen
zich de mensen die naar het hoogland gaan op zoek naar
goud De zwoele dampen uit het bos verraderlijk vermengd
met de fijne geur van muskus en tonkabomen verdoezelt hun
denken en de hypnotische blikken der dieren verlammen hun
schjeden de giftige zoethe id van het water vertroebelt
hun bleed en benevelt hun oog
De hete gouddroom voert ze in de webbe van taaie lia
nen de metershoge petalen van de vleesbloemen sluiten
zich om hen heeno  c ze keren nooit meer terug
In het woud wreekt dit land zich over de gouddorst
van de vreemdelingen
De goudzoeker die geen respect heeft voor de
schone natuur wordt door de natuur zelf ge
straft

Is er wel een book over deLifest dat zo sugges

dit land In dit boek Yordt de hoof dr ol niet gesneeld
door de mensen maar door de NATUUR en haar allesever
heersende stilte die tegelijkertijd haar SCHOONBEID is
Toen voor het eerst heb ik gedacht stil te staan en
daar te sterven toen voor het eerst hob ik al de angst
gevoeld van heel mijn volk o moedige Caraiben al uw
schimmen stonden met saamgeklemde tanden in alagorde om
mij heen en ik zag het nietJ al uw angst voor de lege

Maar leefde in mijn vader opeens de zoon der savanna
Yeer sterker dan ooit Zondor een Yroord te zeggen zette
hij mij op zijn schouder en droeg mij urenver naar het

zijn durf zijn kracht neen al de oude kracht van mijn
volk o brfcive Caraiben heb ik in rnij opgezogen een zvel

zijn grote opmerkingsgave gepaard aan een
treffende manier van zeggen oerwouden woes

wordt hij door de natuur geboeid dat zijn
personages vaak min of meer vergeten worden
Van het dorp dat je nog met de boot bereiken kon

rottende boomstammen en dikke mossen Het was er donker en

Ziezo Carnaval is weer voorbij Aan feesten etc is
voorlopig een eind gekomen en meteen zitten we weer in
een serieuze tijd niet alleen wat de vasten betreft
maar onze tiende klaasers zullen over weken volop in hun
schriftelijk examen zitten Wij wensen STERKTE en SUCCES
Op de volgende bladzijde bl breekt n van onze
trouwe lezers een lans voor de ARMEN op ons eiland en levert
daarbij een goedbedoelde kritiek op het geschenk voor Prin
ses Beatrix en Claus van Amsberg Graag wil de redaktie
vr je dat artikel leest Por el amor de Dios het volgende
opmerken Bet koninklijk Paar heeft ondertussen ZELF bepaald
dat de opbrengst voor dit geschenk besteed zal worden voor
DE GEHANDICAPTE KINDEREN VAN DE ANTILLEN pa muchanan
mancaron zoals dat ook zal gebeuren in de andere rijksdelen
Dit is wel een heel erg mooi gebaar van het Koninklijk Paar
en we hopen dat niettegenstaande die goedbedoelde kritiek
het bedrag tch nog zal groeien tot het welzijn van ONZE
KINDEREN DIE NIET GEZEGEND ZIJN MET EEN GEZOND LICHAAMyLMyji ct DJOS
Iedereen lij waar je ook komt iedereen rraat over
het huwelijk van Prinses Beatrix en Glaus van Amsberg Ie
dpreen heeft er belangstelling voor En ze zijn zelfs begon
nen met gfeld op tehalen voor een geschenk voor het Konink
lijk Paar
liaar toch is er en groephier op het eiland die er
zelfs geen tijd voor om hierover na te denken die
hebben belangrijker dingenom over te einzen vol vrees
denken ie aan wat de vlgende dag voor hen zal brengen
Boor de mee sten van onsworden de ze vergeten
Het zijn de ARMEN Ja hier op ons eiland zijn er heel
wat die hulp veel hulp nodig hebben Op alle gebied komen
ze te kort ze hebben niet voldoende te eten niet voldoen
de kleren en vooral de kinderen zijn er de duoe van want
die kunnen zelfs niet naar school
AMTCAL doet zijn uiterste best om dit probleem hier
op Aruba op te lossen maar och we weten dat de belangstel
ling hiervoor nog lang niet groot genoeg is ik bedoel daad
werkelijke belangstelling
Goed het is prachtig als we eengeschenk willen geven
aan het Koninklijk Paar maar laten we dan eerst onze armen
helpen die hebben het ook veel harder nodig Toen onze
Koningin en Prinsop Aruba kwamen was het groot feest en de
regering heeft vl geld gebruikt om het eiland te versieren
Prachtig maar wat hadden ze allemaal voor de armen kunnen
doen met ditzelfde geld het zou mr waarde gehad hebben
fpU Koningin dit ook niet een reuzeidee gevonden hebben
VReb j Of is dit alln maar een zaak voor onze Priesters
en Freres De beste versiering van het eiland zou vol
gens mij geweest zijn de armoede opruimenAls men de armen helpt dan wordt je naam niet ergens
hier op de wereld in een groot boek geschreven je wordt
niet gevierd omdat je een goede daad hebt verricht maar
wl zul je je belning ontvangen bij de Goede Vader Daar
boven God die alles ziet die zal je betalen Daarom
zgt een arme altijd Una iimosna por el amor de Dios
Je leest vaak in de kranten dat er weer zo of zoveel
duizenden guldens gevraagd of gegeven worden voor een of
ander hotel of iets dergelijks maar hoe dikwijls lees je
tGeld of hulp gevraagd voor de  armen En dan is Aruba
nog maar zo klein hoe zal dat dan wel zijn in andere delen
van de grote wereld
Laat ons eens denken aan al diegenen die echt veel zor
gen hebben die bang zijn voor de dag van morgen
Kun je zlf niet helpen bid dan tenminste voor hen en bid
dat er meer mensen zullen inzien dat ze moeten helpen

avonden zouden we ook deze keer dansen
Ondanks de grote drukte die op beide scholen vooraf
ging werd het R C A gebouw die avond toch niet zo erg
druk bezocht er waren wel meisjes en jongens genoeg
maar we kregen toch de indruk dat lang niet alle leerlingen
van de de en de klassen van beide scholen tegenwoordig
waren
Het feest zou om half acht beginnen maar het was over
achten toen de voortreffelijke teenersband van de Tru
pialen een vrolijk lied inzette
Nadat onze hoofdredakteur Emile Herd iedereen een
hartelijk welkom had toegeroepen opende hij het feest met
onze ijverigste redaktrice Olga Buckley Na deze openings
dans verschenen meer paartjes op de vloer maar de zaal bleef
halfvolTot de steelband inzette met zijn vrolijke op
gewekte tonen Men raakte op slag in de echte Carnavals
stemming Bijna iedereen begon te zingen en te springen en
we zagen zowaar ook enkele onderwijzers meehuppelen Op de
maat van de muziek natuurlijk
Zuster Dorothea was in het begin van de avond even aan
wezig maar ging tamelijk vroeg naar huis Jammer genoeg
Misschien had ze haar pupillen niet eens herkend als ze hen
zo had zien jurnpen Een onderwijzer van het MC werd zo
waar door n van zijn leerlingen ten dans gevraagd Dat
had hij nooit durven dromen en zielsgelukkig leidde hij haar
naar de dansvloer waar hij bewees een uitstekende dans
partner te zijn
Ook zagen wij andere onderwijzers met leerlingen dansenvan wie we beslist kunnen verzekeren nietdoor de dames te
zijn gvPaagJJ Opvallend was het wel dat er bijia geen leer
krachten van ht LSC aanwezig waren terwijl die van het
MC op een enkele na present varen
Ife rekten het feest tot over twaalven Nog n set met
Los Principes bedelde men bn daarna moest de steekband
nog een opwindende set weggeven
Bet was tegen kwart voor een toen de meisjes hun reeds
wachtende ouders buiten opzochten Een geslaagde schoolfuif
was ten einde
Hulde aan frre Gerardo zuster Dorothea frre Arnold de
band van de Trupialen Los Principes en de stealband en aan
iedereen die heeft meegewerkt om onze schoolfuif tot een
aangename en onvergetelijke avond te maken

Laatst wandelde ik langs de beach Bet was een zonnige
zaterdagmiddag Terwijl ik daar in het witte zand liep begon
ik Tfeer luchtkastelen te bouwen Dat deed ik nu altijd als ik
niets te doen had Qpens dacht ik he wat zou het leuk zijn
om filmster te worden Ba dat was net iets voor mij Ik oe
doel natuurlijk niet een van die kleine niet beroemde film
sterretjes maar een fameuze acteur Ja zo iemand als Paul
Newmand Charlton ifeston of Gregory Peck Zon acteur zou ik
willen worden
Een filmster die grote rollen krijgt Een filmster die
over de gehele wereld bekend is en die duizenden fans heeft
Dan zou ik wel drie of vier mensen moeten betalen om al de
post te beantwoorden En het geld Oh ik zou dan zoveel geld
verdienen dat ik alles zou kunnen k open wat ik wil
Eerst zou ik een huis bouwen van vijf a zes kamers het
een grote tuin een zwembad twee garages enz Twee garages
Ja want ik koop twee autos n voor mijn dagelijkse werk
een Ford Mustang en een voor s zondagseen Polls Royce
Ook zou ik veel aandelen kopen en een grote zaak oprichten
zodat wanneer ik oud ben ik mijn schaapjes op het droge zal
hebben n natuurlijk zal ik ook Amical helpen met dui
zenden dollars
En trouwen Trouwen Wee hoor Trouwen do ik niet In
ieder geval niet als ik filmster ben Want zon leven leiden
als Richard Burton en nog een paar van die venten dat wji ik
niet We Ir un hebben met al diemeisjes uit Bolliwoodi Ja
dat wel maar trouwen Neen ieder geval voorlopig niet
Maar j dat zal ik later wel beslissen Als ik fllkister Ben

Als je op Aruba in de stad gaat rondlopen dan betekent
dat eigenlijk niet zoveel als eldersBier betekent dat
allSn maar lopen in n straat do NassaustratMl
Yaarkun je a nders gaan Als je oe n zijstraat inslaat
dan ben je eigenlijk al op YJOg naar huis Maar n ding is
zeker als je va n het ene eind naar het andere loopt on te
rug duurt dat zeker d r ie kwartier
Ten eerste loop je op je gemak met een vriend eh dan
loop je maariom te lopen Je staat vijf minuten voor elke
etalage en kies je geliefde coats shirts en broeken uit
Soms ga je een winkel binnen alleen ma ar om er de
mensen la stig te vallens dan zoek je oen paar dingen opje
vraagt hoeveel zo kosten on je zegt da n heel serieuss Sor
ry ik heb mar tien gulden bij me Maarals je da n pech
hebt zegge n ze je dat je het voor deze keer ook voor
tien gulden kant krijgen dan moet je zelf maar zien om
je uit die hacho lijke toestand te redden
Onde r hot wandelen ontmoet je a f n toe eons een
vriend of vriendin waarmee je ook w eer vijf minutenbezig
bentj na nog vpol etalagegekijk en babbeltjes hier en daar
koo je dan aan het andere eind hier sta je dan nog een tijd
je naarde voorbijgangers te kijken en de terugreis va ngt
weer arm
De terugreis gaat met dezelfde snelheid en met de nodig
tussenlandingen maar nu langs dezuidelijke route
Ongeveerihalvorwegh ga jk een cafeetje binnenom iets
to gebruikenvoor n Jjopsi eb je zeker vijftien minuten
nodig om hot op te drinponen dan stapje maar weer opy
on over co n kwartier ben je weer aan het eind punt
Daar sta je dan weer op je gaiak zon twintig minuten voor
dat j weer met je reis begint maar nu eerst vid de zuide
lijke route om dan weer langs de noordelijke route ter ug
te keren
Wanneer je dit heerlijke geslenter moe bont ga je
naar huis om de volgende dag weer met je goedbovallcnreis
te beginnen
Zo zijn er mens en die dat jaren aan nstuk volhouden
maar ikzelf ee rlijk gezegd had er de eerste keer al ge

Vermoeide correctors door de telefoon Ik heb hier twee
blaadjes van jouw klas waar geen naam op staat Weet jij
misschien welke jongens van jouw klas geen naam hebben
Collega Neen het spijt me maar ik kan je niet helpen Ik
heb toevallig de namenlijst van mijn klas hier voor me
liggen Maar ik zie niemand die geen naam heeft Vraag
het de jongens morgen zelf maar eens die weten zeker of
ze een naam hebben of niet
Corrector Dank je Bedankt voor die hint Peinzend Vreemd
dat die man niet weet wie van zijn leerlingen geen naam
heeft Bet schooljaar is nu al ongeveer zes maanden bezig
Waarschijnlijk is hij wat vermoeid De vacantie is
ook al weer zo lang voorbij
ingezonden door een leraarCeen no i v at M
Op sterk aandringen van de kant van de redaktre en
ook vanwege een zekere vroeging van mijn kant besluit
ik in een opwelling om maar weer is naar mijn trouwe ganzen
veer te grijpen
Ik ben opgeruimd en vol goede moed iYaar zullen we
het deze keer over hebben Over kostscholen Ik zit niet op
een internaat dus dat gaat alvast niet Toch wel jammer
maar afin De redaktie heb ik maar pas een keer met een be
zoek vereerd kunnen we ook wel laten vallen dus Nou ja
zo erg is het nu ook weer niet ze kunnen mijn kritiek best
missen Niet dat ik me er iets van aantrek hoor dat niet
Maar toch
Komaan wat zit ik hier nog verder te mediteren ik
moet een onderwerp zien te vinden een onderwerp waar ik
over schrijven kan waar ik over schrijven kan als een
meester Wa rneq ikde lezers en lezerressen van BDK
door mijn frapante stijl ons Colegio wat ahw in
boeien kan slaan Sst Niemand heeft me toch gehoord
Ze moesten een weten dat ik eigenlijk maar een doodgewone
opschepper ben Neen gelukkig niemand in de buurt
Hn Kwestie Vietnam dan maar Kom nou laat ik nou
niet den alsof ik er iets van afweet Als het or poli
tiekvan het eerste plan aankomt heb ik er toch geen kaas
van gegeten Ook al van de baan dus
Blijft niet veel over wel De School Komaan ik ben
toch niet meer op school Ik zit op het Colegio ahum
Maar wat zwam ik toch Ik moet toch wel iets kunnen vin
den Een boom gaan opzetten over de aspecten van de ruim
tevaart een boom op schrift zeker Bovendien snappen
den ze het toch niet de uilskuikensTut tut niet zo hoog van de toren blazen jongeman
of moet ik zeggen verwaande kwast een beetje meer be
scheiden kan het ook wel hoor Tr Dat was de stem uit mijn
binnenstee Moet ik me daaraan storen Eenvoud siert de mens
toe maar Toch begin ik te geloven dat ik een beetje blas
wordtMaar nu begin ik mijn geduld te verliezen Overigens
zij opgemerkt dat ik niet zo gauw mijn geduld verlies
Daar is wel wat voor nodig al zeg ikhet zelf Ik zou het
zo willen stellen dat ik toch wel een hm nou vooruit
dan maar dat ik over het algemeen toch wel een evenwicht je
natuur bezit Bezit ik misschien ook nog een heldere oogop
slag waarmee ik in een oogwenk mijn hele omgeving op zijn
waarde kan taxeren Neen toch maar niet Nooit teveel van
het goeie willen hebben zo
Opschepper Pendante vent Als je toch zoveel goede
eigenschappen hebt waarom kom je dan niet op een onderwerp
als jouw bijdrage voor BDK yiaarom niet Nou dan
Dat was alweer die stem uit mijn binnenste Moet ik hem nou
het zwijgen opleggen of niet Ik begin mezelf te verfoeien
Bovendien wat zal de redaktie zeggen als ik met hangende
pootjes terugkom zonder onderwerp met alleen een paar
onbenullige zinnen op papier
Toch maar de redaktie weer eens onder schot nemen
Ze zien me al aankomen Hoe komt ie alweer op zon origi
neel idee En ik voor aap staan zeker Dan maar geen
onderwerp Ik vertik het me nog langer suf te moeten pie
keren Ik heb er tabak van Geen inspiratie deze keer

GROETEN VAN EEN TROUW SCHRIJVER EN LEZER UIT NEDERLANDS
Juist te laat voor het vorige nummer kregen we een postkaart
van onze vriend CARLOS TRINDAD die sinds enige maanden in
Den Haag zit en zijn schoolkameraden nog niet vergeten is
Hij vindt het erg koud in het koude land en het was in het
begin nogal moeilijk om er te wennen Het wordt nu lekker
warm en we hopen dat het wennen ook beter zal worden
Hiermede aan al onze abonnees zijn hartelijke groeten

Geef ons de vrede wordt er da
delijks in honderdenkerken op de
wereld gebeden
De oorlog is geindigd nu leven
we in vrede leren de schoolkin
deren braaf uit hun boekje
natuurlijk niemand voert oorlog
maar betekent dat dat de wereld nu
in volkomen rust en vreedzaamheid
voortloeft Is het woord vrede
merkelijk een juiste tegenstelling
van oorlog
Was het maar waarl Zelfs hier op onze Antillen waar naar
het schijnt iedereen in harmonie samenleeft gebeuren er vaak
ellendige ongelukken waarbij een moeder in en dag drie kin
deren moet afstaan aan de eeuwigheid Zal die moeder ooit
vrede krijgen in haar verdere leven
Moordgepleegd door een broer op zijn bloedeigen zus
Een meisje dat met haar broer in een auto rijdt komt in het
ziekenhuis terecht en als ze bijkomt wordt haar verteld
Haar broer is dood
Zullen de negers in het zuiden van de Verenigde Staten ooit
begrijpen dat dezelfde blanke Amerikanen die nu hun leven
tot oen hel maken eens nog in deze twintigste eeuw vrede
gesleten hebben met de hele wereld
Of de Cubanen die nu lijden onder de tirannieke regering van
G stro zouden zij meegezucht hebben van opluchting
samen mot ons toen tuisland zijn schepen terugtrok na de be
slissende uitspraak van Kennody Gelukkig er was bijna
oorlcgi
Do mensen in Vietnam wier pasgeboren kinderen het woord het
bedrieglijke woord vrede nooit zullen kennenEn zo zijn er ontelbare gevallen te noemen over heelde
wereld
Het is te bgrijpen dat bij het horen van de woordens
Vrede op aan de mensen van goede wln op more g
gezicht een grimmig lachje te zien is Vrede op aarde
wie kent nog de echte betekenis van dat woord

PLANNENVANEENTIEMERCLUBHet onderstaande azen
we in een krant van
een klein dorp in Nederland Deze tieners wilden iets mr
doen  Er was een oude man bij n van de leiders ge
komen Hij zei Jullie hebben zoveel jongekerels en flinr
ke meisjes kan er niet eentje mij komen helpen want ik
ben te oud en te stijf om houtjes voor de kachel te hakken
Er werd in de vergadering nog een brief voorgelezen Ik
ben zo verschrikkelijk eenzaam ik ken geen gezellig
heid thuis als ik sterf huilt er geen mens om mij
niemand zal mij missen
Toen kwamen ineens de plannen het jeugdig idealisme brak
los m ZULLEN DE MENSEN GAAN OPZQEKEN DIE ONS NODIG HEB
BEN DIE vU KUNNEN HELPEN
Ze gingen de zieken opzoeken vooral die eenzaam thuis
in bed lagen er werd voor hen gewerkt eten gekookt en
vooral heel veel gepraat want dat doen die zo graag
Zieke leerlingen werden opgezocht en de lessen van de
school werden uitgelegd
Invaliden werden rondgereden in hun wagentjes op plaat
sen waar ze nog nooit geweest waren De ogen van deze
vergeten mensen strAdlden
Huismoeders zagen meisjes voor hen de was doen en naai
en en de babysittersM zorgden voor de kinderenZoals je veet ben ik op weg naar mijn tweede jaar hier in
Holland Achteraf gezen gaat het heel vlug Als je hier zit
begrijp ie het spreekwoord Tijd is Geld ook veel beter
Hier gaat alles n op een hoog tempo Bijvoorbeeld om zoals
op Apuba eventjes onder een kwihiboom te gaan rusten en een
dutjp te doen hoef je zelf niet in je hoofd te krijgen hier
Daar is het trouwens te koud voer
Je bent hier maar al bezig en moet je leren je tijd goed
te verdelen over de belangrijkste dingen die je te doen hebt
Als v de leraren je daar op Aruba zeggen Jongens gebruik
en besteed je tijd goed want niet overal op de wereld heb je
zon overvloed van tijd Dan denk je in jezelf Klets niet
man de tijd is afhankelijk of beter gezegd houd verband met
de klok en die loopt overal op de wereld even vlug Maar
laten we maar van dit onderwerp afstappen tijd is n zoTn
moeilijke kwestie dat zelfs Eins tein er zich jaren mee bezig
hield en zijn Re lat ivite ittheor ie samenstelde
Deze dagen vroor hut wel vier weken achter mekaar en zijn
allesloten meertjes en Kanalen dicht gaan liggen Nou ein
delijk kan ik gaan leren schaatsen Vorig jaar kon dat niet
wantten hadden we n en zacht wintertje Nou hier kunnen
zelfs de kleinste wezentjes schaatsen dus ik zou het en moest
het ook leren Ts Avonds laat om half twaalf ging ik met Minguel
Reyes schaatsen Nou schaatsen kun je eigenlijk niet zeggen
Het was strompelen vallenen opstaan Zwaaien en glijden
Ja het had meer iets van kunstschaatsen Na een les of
konden we ons vooruitbewegen en gingen toen ook overdag met
een jroep jongelui schaatsen
Ik moet behoorlijk hard werken ant in mijn klas zitten
vele HBSluitjes en U TSers Nou daar moet ik tegenop

De meeste keren dat er over de jeugd geschreven wordt
gebeurt dit door volwassenen Hun mening over ons is niet al
tijd erg gunstig Het zou wel interessant zijn om nu iets
over dit onderwerp te lezen geschreven door een jeugdig per
soon
Vaak horen wij volwassenen zuchten Maar moet dat naar
toe met die jeugd van tegenwoordigJ Ze kunnen niets anders
dan MYeahYeah schreeuwen en hun ouders grijze haren be
zorgen Nu mag een meisje gerust helemaal alleen de straat
op vroeger was dat onmogelijk En de kleding van tegenwoordig
daar vinden de ouderen ook niets aan r is veel veranderd
maar zeker niet in ongunstige zin De moderne jeugd houdt er
van om lekker gek te doen Althans een deel van de jongelui
Niet iedere jongeling moet beschouwd worden als een nozem of
Beatlefan Mijn vrienden en ik bv houden helemaal niet van
beatmuziek en wij doen niet an de Beatlerage mee Me houden
meer van Zuidamerikaanse muziek en vinden jongens met lange
haren alleen maar belachelijk In de buurt waar mijn vrienden
wonen zie je nooit zon nozem met lange manen slordige kleren
en een stank vanwege het zelden baden Dor zulke gekke ge
woonten halen ze zich alleen maar onze minachting op de hals o
De mening van oudere mensen dat de jeugd nu veel bal
dadiger is dan vroeger vind ik totaal in strijd met de waar
heid Door de nozems en andere jongelui die niet goed wijs
zijn wordt hun een totaal verkeerd beeld gegeven van wat de
moderne jeugd is Voor zulke jongens en meisjes die zich pro
vos noemen en soms zelfs muizen in hun kleren laten leven
en in hun mond laten kruipen kan ik geen enekel woord van
waardering opbrengen Bet zou beter zijn als zij dat onfrisse
gedoe vergaten en wat meer aan gezonde sport gingen doen
Ik ben tegen nozem s en provoTs en zulke dingen maar ik
wil niet dat zij als voorbeeld van de hele moderne jeugd aan
de kaak gesteld worden yVant zij vormen het deel vande jeugd
dat in de ogen van de volwassenen het voor de anderen bederven

NZE MISSIEAKTIE
Twee jaar geleden heeft onze school een seminarist geadop
teerd Dat is PAUL RAJ die studeert in Bangalore in het verre
Indik het land dat tegenwoordig volop in het nieuws is wegens
de honger en de armoede vah dit miljoenenvolk
Onder dat adopteren verstonden we toen een bijdrage van
het na Salie College om te helpen dat hij een goed priester zou
wordh een goed leider onder zijn volk een mens die in staat
zou pijn om God dichter bij zijn volk en om het Indiase volk
dichter bij God te brengen
DIE HULP BESTAAT UIT ONS GEBD EN ONS OFFER
Ons gebed is moeilijk uit te tellen Maar het is wel erg
voorpaam Christus zelf spoort ons aan m in gns gebed arbei
ders te vragen in Zijn wijngaardOns offer bestaat uit een geldelijke bijdrage Liefst geen
geld uit de buidel van Vader of Moeder maar zelf gespaard
van ons zakgeld Dat is wel uit te tellen De studiekosten van
PaulRaj bedragen ongeveer NAf
Dat komt dus per klas op een kleine twintig gulden per
jaar De klas die daar onder blijft rekent on andere klassen
waar de jongens er meer voor over hebben En dat is niet
Sportief
Laten we er een EREZAAK van maken in elke klas die
twintig gulden te halen

fr NorbertusSonia schiet op klonk de stem van mijn broertje in
j de gang Ik deed gauw mijn polshorloge om pakte mijntasje en
kwam de kamer uit Daar stond mijn broertje trappele ndvan
ongeduld op me te wachten Schiet toch op We komen te laat
Mama en papa wachten al lang op jouIk ben al klaar hoor
I Kom maar mee Ik nam hem bij de hand en samen gingenwe naar
de huiskamer
RinggsrgJ De bel ging Wie zou daar zijn Misschien was
het wel een van de deugnieten die weer aan de bel trokken Ik
besloot maar niet te gaan kijken en liep naar de huiskamer o
Voor ik de deur van de huiskamer binnenging klonk het weer
j RingggJ Ik draaide me om en liep naar de deur terwijl ik
dacht Wie zou er in godsnaam toch hier aanbellen op zoTn on
i verwachte tijd Ik maakte open en even later stond ik voor een
onbekende nogal wat oude man die me vroeg of mijn vader thuis
was Ik liet hem binnen en vroeg wie ik kon zeggen dat er was
Tegelijkertijd dacht ik had ik hem maar gezegd dat vader er
niet was misschien zal hij nu wel een lang gesprek met vader
aanknopen en dan zouden we te laat komen voor de f ilm
Ik ging naar de huiskamer toe en vertelde pa dat Meneer
Earold Smiths er was Vader stond verbaasds Harold SmfhhsV
herhaalde hij laat hem binnen Wie is hij vroeg moeder o
Hij is een oudbuurman van mij Toen ik nog een jongen was
heb ik hem eens geplaagd Hij heeft me toen een flink pak
slaag gegeven en sindsdien is hij ook de stad uitgegaan
Meneer Halley kwam binnen groette vader hartelijk gaf moeder
een hand en tikte mijn broertje even op de wang Deze trok een
gezicht tegen hem Moeder zag dit en gaf me een wenk om met
hem naar buiten te gaan Ik pakte hem bij de hand en samen
gingen we naar de auto Het was Ifyirart voor vier en om vier
uur zou de film beginnen Gaan we nog vroeg mijn broertje
Ja zei ik maar eerst moet die meneer vertrekken
Even was het stil toen zei hij weer Ik wil niet in
de auto blijven ik wil naar binnen naar die meneer
Ik vermoedde niet wat zijn plan was dus starten wij uit en
gingen wre naar de huiskamer
Daar aangekomen vonden we onze ouders druk in gesprek met de
meneer Mijn broertje die pas vijf was en een ehte deug
niet stapte recht op de meneer af pakte zijn hand vast en
ze ij U moet nou weg gaan want wij moeten naar de film
Moeder werd rood Ik zelf stond daar als aan de grond ge
nagald Vader wist niet wat te zeg en En de meneer
Hij lachte tegen mijn broertje en z ei Bet spijt me maar
ik Wist niet dat hij naar de film moets met je papa en mama
Hij stond pp en gaf vader een hand Vader wilde zich veront
schuldigen Maar daar wilde hij niets van horen Kinderen
zijn kinderen Het zijn ook de enigen die met de waarheid
voor de dag komen Ik zal wel een andere keer langs komen
zei hij Hij groette ons allen en vertrok
Het was vijf voor vier Vfe stapten gauw in de auto en waren
juist op tijde Al kregen wij geen goede plaats meer We waren
er toch dank zij mijn broertje

Uit een opstel en toen slaakte hij een hart van verzuch
tingoor in
Laatst wandelde ik langs de beach Bet was een zonnige
zaterdagmiddag Terwijl ik daet in het witte zand liep begon
ik zo te riekeren over alles en nog wat Opeens dacht ik Be
watzou dat leuk zijn om voor n dag als onderwijzer voor de
klas te staanTt Natuurlijk waren er voordelen en nadelen aan
verbonden maar het zou toch wel mee kunnen vallen Ik zou die
da bijvoorbeeld wat vroeger op school moeten zijn als onder
wijzer hoort dat nu eenmaal kaar dat was zo erg niet want
zo klein gesprek met de andere onderwijzers voor schooltijd
was wel leuk vooral omdat ik ze nu collegafs zou kunnen noe
men
Ook zou ik in elke klas willen komen In de zevende klas
zou ik krans en Algebra les geven Dat zijn nu eenmaal mijn
twee slechtste vakken Maar ik denk wel dat ik er genoeg van
afweet om die reuters van de zevende klas nog wat bij te le
ren In de achtste klas zou ik ze wat Spaans en Aardrijkskunde
geven o wat over de pretr ito en weet ik nog meer Als ik
daar doorheen kom denk ik wel dat het voor de rest zal slagen
want daar zitten nu eenmaal de grote vlegels
Onder het speelkwartier zou ik de
wacht willen hebben Iedereen zou die
n maca
dag vrij mogen vreglopen om even
ron te gaan kopen als ze mij ook maar
niet zoudenvergeten En daarna onder
de godsdienstles
in de de klas
lekker koffie drin
I J ken en de jongens
n v  f even allemaal weer
a V v P gede spoor
T brengen Daarna
xi tekenles in een
I andere negende klas
V l rmrn Yvi v vi rEven wat moderne
kunst en weet ik
nogwat meer Hat is gemakkelijk niet om iets te
vinden wat ze allemaal leuk vinden
In de tiende klas kan ik natuurlijk het laatst
Daar zou ik ze wel ecu leren wat nu eigenlijk Vela
is En mijn laatste les ik kies natuurlijk een dins
dar f een donderdag zou ik gymles in a geven Eerst
vijf minuten lichaamsoefeningen Ze hebben er nu een
maal een hekel aan en daarna volleyball Natuurlijn
ga ik dan ook meespek n om ze ven te laten zien dao
een onderwijzer ook vlot kan zijn
Maar na zon dag denk ik wel dat ikhet niet meer
in miin hoofd zal halen om het nog eens te proberen
Onderwijzer worden Nee dat is niets voor mij En
vooral niet op het LSC want daar is het heus geen
aartsparadijs hoor

Dat Richard Piternella gedurende twee jaargangen de puzzel
redakteur van Bao di Kwihi ons nog niet vergeten is bewijst
deze geweldige puzzel wel waar hij ongetwijfeld heel wat uur
tjes aan heeft moeten werken Degenen die wel eens een puz
zel in elkaar gestoken hebben weten hoe moeilijk het is om
hem helemaal kloppend te maken
Richard schrijft verder in een brief aan de redaktie dat hij
het verder uitstekend maakt dat hij blij is dat de ergste
kou voorbij is en dat er zelfs al weer EEN BEETJE ZON is
Verder ontvangen redaktie en abonnees zijn hartelijke groeten
en belooft hij nog een artikel over het zijn leven in Neder
land hier zijn we natuurlijk erg benieuwd nasar vooral diege
nen die spoedig ook dit Tkouwe land zullen gaan opzoeken

door I AURA vffiRNEI
Twee nannen kregen eens ruzie over him afkonst rWat
verbeeld je je vel zsi de een je Dent niet anders dan n
doodgewone indiaan Dat je een blanke kleur hebt is alleen
naar te danken aan het Engelse schip dat jaar geleden
hier voor Aruba ankerde De Indiaantjes die zich tussen het
hoge gras foenfoen genaaad bevonden zagen het wonderdingZe trippelden als gekken naar het schip toe en de Engel
sen anuseerden zich kostelijk net die lcleine wezentjes Ze
strooiden pinda op het dek on ze te lokken De Indiaantjes
anuseerden zich k ze lieten zich lokken door de blanken
en toen ze later aan land gingen tussen het hoge gras en hun
rustig leventje weer voortzetten verden er allenaal blanke
kinderjes geboren
En die Indianen zijn onze stanouders van nij van jou
en van de neeote Arubanen En nou jiji
oxoxoxoxoxo
De verschillende schepen hebben ons de versohillende
bewoners gebracht Spanjaarden Hollanders Engelsen Fran
sen en Portugezen De Spanjaarden kwanen het eerst Naar
men xegt ongeveer tien jaar na de ontdeldcing van Anerika
Die brachten het katholieke geloof en ze behandelden de In
dianen goed
Maar al heel gauw kwanen kapers op de leust De nensen
noenden ze piraten en die piraten waren Hollanders
Ze roof den wat ze konden en waarschi jnli jk vemoordden ze
k wat ze konden k het katholieke geloof
NU kennen we de Nederlanders als goede rette nensen
En de elite Nederlanders oa do Priesters de Zusters do
Freres nensen die hier zijn gokonen voor de verspreiding
van het veloof en voor de opvoeding die zijn zulke edele
kOyOOXXXXXXXXXYYYYYyYYYYYYTyyYyyYIYYT fc
nensen als je naar zelden tegenkont Maar die Hollanders
van de de eeuw waren ruwe zeevaarders avonturicrs on ze
kwamen hier alleminst on hot geloof te vcrspreiden
Later kwamen de Engelsen natuurlijk ook geen fijae jon
getjes en die speelden ook een tijdje de baas Zelfs de
Franson noeten het geprobeerd hebben zich neester te naken
van het eiland Texuninste dat be we re n sonnige nensen Ze ver
tellen dat Rooi France s herinnert aan die tijd toon er
slag geleverd werd tussen de bewoners en de Franseny De heu
vels bij Rooi Frances werden hun Waterloo want ze werden tot
de laatste nan verbrand in hun schuilplaats
Anderen noenen het gevluchte Fransen die daar een schuil
plaats hadden gezocht naar de bevolking verdacht ze van Hin
der goede bedoelingen Ze werden verbrand naar enkelen wis
ten te ontsnappen en bleven hier wonen In ieder geval koes
teren nog steeds heel wat nensen vrees voor deze pick Er is
heel wat nocd voor nodig on s nachts deze weg te nenen
En degenen die dat s nachts doen zien en horen altijd
wat t Zijn de geesten van de Fransen die daar vernoord
zijn Anderen die minder last van hun geweten hebben hebben
doze plaats wel eens gebruikt on te verstoppen wat ze graag
kwijt willen er is dan ook neer dan eens een lijk gevonden
Volgens onze oudere generatie bestond de bevolking uit
die tijd enkel uit neesters en slaven Maar er kwamen steeds
nieuwe families bij die dan goon slaven waren Hollanders
de zg zwarte Fransen Mulatten Indianen uit Colombia
zelfs Joodse nanen stonden in die tijd hier bekend
De neesters shon waren neestal Hollanders naar or wa
re n ook neesters die niet blank waren en ook nict zeer rijk
Deze shons waren niet kieskeurig in de keuze van hun echt
genote n  Zo lcreeg je veel slavinnenkinderen net een
aardje naar hun vaartje en die waren dan echt blank
In vyerd de slave mi j afgeschaft we kregen een vrije
Arubaanse bevolking die zijn kost verdlende in de goudbedrij

Elk dag lopen honderden jongens langs het Maria Col
lege Meestal tussen twaalf en een Maar dan komt er een
n jeep in de buurt en ze ftioeten vluchten
Als de ze mensen met hun catcatcher komen dan kun je de jcn
pens pas zien rennen Voordat deze rustverstoorder komt
staan sommige jongens braaf naar de meisjes to kijken en an
dere lopen zich be vervelen en ok anderen
Zo bederft de een het voor de ander
De politie gaab naar het Maria College om alleen maar
te kijken of er geen jongens rond lopen maar zij geven zelf
hun ogen goed de kost
Sommige meisjes zeggen dat zij boos worden als zij mer
ken dat een jongen steeds maar naar haar blijft kijken
Maar deze TEngeltjesTt van het Maria College beslist niet
Zij gaasn zelfs tot dicht bij het hek staan Zij die dat niet
durven maken allerlei gebaren en seinen Op deze manier pra
ten zij met de jongens die buiten staan
Als de bel van het Maria College gaat dsan hebben de jon
gens van het La Salle College nog a minuten om naar school
te gaan Dit is erg leuk van onze frere Arnold Hij geeft tenj
minste zijn medewerking maar ja alles gaat goed totdat de
politie met hun mousecatcher weer komt en daan moet men vluch
ten schuldig of onschuldig Maar ik vind dat als je een
kwartier naar de meisjes kunt staan kijken je daarna vol goe
de moed weer aan het werk kunt gaan
Morgens zijn de jongens slaperig maar middags niet b
Ik het zelfs gehoord dat er een Fanclub is opgericht en dee b
Fanclub heet de Maria College Boys Laten we hopen dat de n
politie tenminste deze jongens met rust laat

Ito TrmpDoch eenieder draaide zich om haar eengedempt gesnik
Ach het is de hl inde zei een herder tot Mot ia hij heeft
verdriet omdat hij het Kindeke niet Icxn zien
Nee het is daarm niet snikte de blinde Jodocus uit zijn
hoekhomend want iic heb het licht gezien Maargij alle
maaldcunt aan het hindeke wat geven doch hl irn imen
niets geven Is dat nipt droevig Och het snijdt lijk mes
sen door mijn hart Maar smeekte hij dan ootmoedig tot
Maria mag ik u een schoon liedeke speln op mijn viool
t is hetenige wat ik geven kan omdat ik anders niets heb
Blinden zijn geboren om te krijgen
Zeker beste man zei Maria en een trilling van medelij
n was er in haar woorden
Er kwam een stilte diepe stilte en de blinde glimlachte
naariets en toen begon hij te strijken met een edel ge
baar Zijn gelaat werd wit van aandoening en er gleed uit
zijn viool een zang die gestolen scheen van de engelen vandaarstraks Heel hetstalleke tos ermee gevuld en het Kind
zweeg en al de boerenkofpen die bijna nooit iets anders
gehoerd addendan wat zager ige muziek in d kerk of een
polka op do kermis werden van zijn zuiverheid vervuld en
er krom iets over hen dat het schoonste was wat zij bezaten
Over die rwei ongeschoren arme mensen straalde de konink
lijke klaarte van hun ziel en de blinde lekten de tranen
van zijn kaken
En als ht gedaan was enkijn strijkstok nevens hem hong
stond hij weer te glimlachen naar iets omhoog
lk heb het Kind gezien snikte hij ik heb het Kind ge
zien Och ht is zo heerlijk en zo schone

Zalig Kerstfeest en Zalig Nieuwjaar namens het Mariacollege
Moge de woorden en vrede op aarde aan alle mensen van
goede wil voor jullie allemaal persoonlijk waarheid worden
De nieuwe bemanning groette ons opgewekt bij de ingang On
willekeurig moest ik even glimlachen toen ik dat stel zag en
dacht In uw handen bevelen wij onze geest Een aleluja
kon ik er echter niet achter jubelen Nog even en we lieten
Europa achter ons Een indrukwekkende herinnering aan een
lichtende stad namen we mee de lucht in Ende nacht in
Urenlang zou ons toestel nu als een eenzame vogel door de
duisternis gaan vliegen Een geschikte tijd om flink te dut
ten Tenminste dat dachten we Voor we echter hieraan moch
ten toegeven kwam er een vemassing fe mochten eens vergeten
dat er iets zou kunnen gebeurenl I
Daarom vers ohenen een steward en een stewardess beiden met
een reddingsgordel in de hand Met een allerliefste glimlach
hielden ze hun betoog Aan een touwtje trekken zus en aan
eentje zo en je zou na een gewaagde sprong uit de nooduit
gangen veilig op de gastvrije oceaan belanden Het opwekkend
ste geval vond ik het batterijtje dat pas zou gaan werken
alshet met water in aanraking kwam Lekker frisi
Zo kon je dan lichtseinen geven Ter afwisseling mocht je
ook op een fluitje blazen als je temiiinste daartoe fut
zou hebben ifet was een interessant en moedgevend rlaas
Ja ja en nu maar rustig gaan slapen Vooral rustig
De lichten werden uitgedraaid op een enkele na De meeste
passagiers deden hun best cm te slapen Ondertussen snelden
we voort op een hoogte van ruim m Buiten heerste er
een temperatuur van gr Binnen merkte je er geliakkig
niks van Mijn buren leken al vredig te slapen Eindelijk
lukte het ook mij evenToen ik mkker werd stijf van de cngemakkelijke houding
ging ik wat lezen en schrijven om de tijd te verdrijven Ik
keek eens naar buiten Wat was dat Werd het buiten lichter
Ja de zon kwam op aan een prachtige koperen hemel v
Een magnifiek gezichtl Het was of je nu vrijer kon ademhalen
Dat kwam door die zichtbare ruimte daarbuiten Er ontstond
beweging onder de mensen De een na de ander ging zich wat
opknappen Dat was wel nodig wilde je straks in Daracas
niet met een lodderig gezicht aankomen
Even latorkregenWC en ontbijt te verwerken waar geen
doorkomen aan was Bijzonder hartigJ dat moet ik bekennen
En om het Yerolddeol Amerika te betreden was zeker wel
kracht nodig Ve vlogen over een berg om onmiddell ijk daarna
met een zachte schok te landen in Caracas
Nauwelijks uit het vliegtuig werden we als ht ware over
speeld door een golf van mrmte Onze kleren en tassen voel
den eigenaardig varm aan Hier moesten we yoortmaken Vlug
watkaarten en postzegels gekocht geschreven en gepost
Tussen al deze bedrijven door gebruikten we een glaasje fris
De vlucht naar Curacao was daarna nog een peuleschilletje
We zochten onze spullen bij elkaar en maakten ondertussen
een praatje Er heerste een gezellige stemming De gezag
voerder sprak zijn wensen uit voor eventuele verdere reizen
Hij was even blij als wij dat we uiteindelijk toch zon
prettige overtocht hadden gehad
Toen wij p Curaao uitstapten ys onze dank ondanks die
eerste hobbelpartijtjes oprecht gemeend De DC had oms
immers veilig en vlug op onze bestemming gebracht

Heis was december en de drie rovers zaten rond het vuui
plannen te maken voor die nacht Het was erg koud Alle drie
kauwden op een grassprietje De hoofdman Gorge stond op en
zei Vannacht kant er een koets langs bij de Rots en die
kunnen we gemakkelijk te pakken krijgen De andere twee Pe S
dro en Lopie knikten Ze verheugden zich al op kisten tot do
rand gevuld met goud nieuwe kleren logeren in een hotel en
een feestelijke maaltijd Jullie kunnen gaan slapen ging
George verder maar als ik jullie een sein geef vertrekken
we Wie niet wakker wordt kan blijven Ik kan het ook alleen j
Natuurlijk gingen de anderen niet slapen en ze wachtten
tot de hoofdman het sein gaf Klokslag twaalf stond de hoofd i
man op trapte met zijn laars tegen een boom en sprong op zijn
paard Meteen volgden de anderen
Zo reden ze in de stille griezelige nacht naar de rots
die ongeroer een kwartier verderop lag Daar aangekomen ver i
stopten ze zich achter een paar struiken en wachtten het mo
ment af waarop de koets voorbij zou gaan Na een paar minuten
hoorden ze in de verte een geroffel dat steeds dichterbij
kwam j
George bond een zakdoek voor zijn mond en de twee volg j
den zijn voorbeeld Gespannen keken Pedro en Lopie naar
George di het teken tot de aanval zou geven
NuJ schreeuwde George en meteen gaven ze hun paarden
de sporen en weg waren ze de koets achterna Ze spoorden hun
paarden sfceeds harder aan maar de afstand tussen hen en de i
koets veranderde niet totdat ze de koets in een grot zagen
verdwijnenK i M
Ze minderden vaat Ban gev lhen ct ze moesten af
stappen tet kloppend hart sprongen ze van hun paanden en
gehnaar de grot waarin de koets was verdwenen Nauwelijks wa
ren ze bij de opening aangekomen of ze werden verblind door
een licht dat uit de grot afkomstig was Ze vielen op h
knion en blcvenmpt hun hoofden op de grond zitten
ze een liove stem hoorden die zeiJKijk Jozef God heefi
ons wat gezelschap gestuurd en het zijn flinke kerels ook
We hoeven ons nuniet bang meerte maken voor rovers en zo
Ja dat zie ik antwoordde een basstem
Bij dit gezegde schaamden de rovers zich verschrikkelijk
ze gedroegen zichals drie kleine kindertjes en prevelden iete
dat op een gebed leek
sta op mannen cn doe alsof je thuis bent zei Jozef
helaad hebben we geen stoelen om u aan te bieden
De amnnen stonden op en zagen toen het liefste kindje dat ze
ooit gezien hadden Ze namen meteen hun proviand en gaven dat
aan tlaria Toen rende Pedro naar buiten en kwam even later
met een paardekens terug die ze op hun paarden hadden om
de nacht door te brengen
God zegene uzei St Jozef en laria dekte haar Kindje
zorgvuldig toe met eon van de dekens

Tegen het feit dat de klasseleraar van c floot werd al

Is een score van volgens o of van volgens o

lernand stuurt kerstkaarten met deze Diededeling erop
Deze kaart is niet meer wat hij een jaar geleden was
maar ach zo staat het met mij ook
Een directeur van een filmmaatschappij die jaar lang
dezelfde kerstkaarten met zijn landhuis had gebruikt ging
nadat hij dat huis verkocht had rustig door met het opma
ken van de duizenden kaarten van zijn voorraadmet een
gestempeld zinnetje erop Wij wonen hier niet meer
Iemand zond met Kerstmis een kaart aan kennissen die een
zaak in tweedehands hoe deren hadden ifet jaar daarop kreeg
hij de kaart terugze hadden zijn naam doorgestreept
en eronder geschreven Van uw leveranciers in tweedehands
goederen
Op januari werden in Mer ika de posttarieven ver
hoogd Een vooruitziend man slaagde erin op elk van zijn
kerstkaarten twee cent te besparen Hij deed ze de laatste
week van december op de bus en typte op de envelofpen
Niet openen voor Kerstmis

Mr V er Teel geschreren OTer het
MC De kranten vulden lange kolammen De radio en de tele
viBie wijdden een deel van hun uitzending eraan Het hele
e liana was er Vjol van
iQo toegzwaaid aan Priorin Meletia die in
met de muloaMeling begon Aan zuster Dorothea die
het werk ran de Priri voortzette Aan de diverse leer
rachten die ooit les hebben gegeven aan dit college en
zodcende meegeholpen hebben de wijsheid uit te dragen aan
de Trouwelijke afdeling van de jeugd
Het MC viert haar zilveren Jubileum Het woord iubi
leum vxaagt onze aandacht al voor iete speoiaals maar als
daar ncg zilveren voor staat wordt het iets buitengewoone
Lange jaren bestaat dit instituut al en gedurende even
xcve e jaren heeft het leorlingen zien komen en gaan Met
en zonder diploma
Het gebouw waar we momenteel in huizen bestaat eohter
nog geen Jaar In verhuisden we vanuit de school tegen
over de kerk naar het nieuwe gebouw Het was wel nog nlet he
letnaal klaar maar we konden er wel in trekken In C was de
gymzaal volledig in orde Nu konden de meisjes in pofbroek met
een rokje eroverheen de gewaagdste cefeningen doen cm de inmid
dels stijve spieren weer in ccnditie te krijgen
Eindelijk kon de school cok ingewijd worden Het inwij
dingsfeest werd met veel luister gevierd Ha de Jilis trok de
prooessie voorafgegaan door de pastoor door de tegenwcordige
Dominioanessenstraat naar het gebouw Bruidjes in het wit met
een blauwe sjerp on listen zien dat de school onder speciale
bescherming Iran de HMaagd kwam te staan In de blinkende gym
zaal werd het pleohtige gedeelte afgewerkt in tegenwoordigheid
van diverse genodigden die bovencip het balkon stonden
Dit feest was een van de hoogtepunten uit de histoirie van
het MCo Er zijn nog enkele van die evenementen Ik kan me ng
herinneren dat de operette Goudhaartje opgevoerd word We
moesben er heleraaal voor naar Bolivariana Het was prachtig
Mevrouw Kelkhoan toen nog juffrouw Hendriks was een geweldige
troubadourl
Met hard leren veel plezier onder eikaar en porties straf
werk vergleden mijn jaren als leerlinge van het MC
Mijn comeback was jaren later en toen bekeek ik het MC
met heel andere mijn tweede MCperiode hebben we
het zilveren kloosttrfeest van zuster Aletta gevierd Alweer
dat woordje zilveren Ik zei al dat het lets bijzonders was
Welnu haar ter ere hebben de leerlingen uit de verschillende
klassen een sprookje uitgebeeld Ee leerkrachten studeerden n
frs toneelstuk in Het witte schaap
Zijn er veel veranderingen gekomen op het MC gedurende
de laatste jaren Hatuurlijk De tijden veranderen men gaat
andere eisen stellen Het MC wordt gedwongen am bij de tijd j
te blijven Ik juioh deze vernieuwingen toe
In de les hebben de meisjes anno het zo gemakkelijkZe hebben allonaal eenboek voor eich met de wi jeheid voor t
bele jaar be volledige grammatica van bet bcrd overpennen is
En de gestenoilde boekjeis waar we Yroeger de
bijvakten leer den zijn iieleniaal anbiek gewcrden
Een feit staat vast wil men haar MCjare n bekroond
zien met een diploma dan zal er cndanks feejst jes veranderin
pn envernieuwigen hard geblokt moeten worden ongeacht het
jaartal vande kalender
Meer dan meisjes hebbenhet gepresteerd gednrende de
laatste kvyarteeuw met hun papiertje te vertrekken
Tegenwoordige MCollegianeh treedt in haar voetspcrenl
Op naar de victorie lil
AXJa toen was ik er al Hadden jiillie niet gedacht he
Nu even wat herinner ingen opschrijven
Hat grote gebouw steeds cmrlngd door belangstellenden stcnd
er nog niet Een zandweg oadushis kortom hetms hier eejii
en al mondi Waar zat de vrouwelijke jeugd dan
Wei de e in de klas bij de stoep van het klooster van
de zusters nu is het spreekkamer en de e in de kieuterklas
van Juffrouw Pina Toen de klassen greater warden trokken we
naar boven naar de club De zaal werd verdeeld in drie Icka
len Het jaar daarop kwam het toneel erbij Het vclgend jaar
werd het kleedkamertje ernaast de lOe klas Het bord stond op
het fonteintje want het was te zwaar voor demuur
En het jaar daarop Er was nog een dakiJ Ja schuin
Gelukkig Benny Etnan zcrgde dat de nieuwbouw werd aangenomen
Het Mariaoollege werd gebcuwd en we trokken er In januari
in
Ziezo dat is iets over de huisvesting
Hoe stond het met de boeken Het was Immers oor log Dias
van Nederland vielniets te veywaohten De e was voorzien
maar  en C We hadden van alle vakken versohillende pre
sentexemplaren in huis Dce het ielfwas het wachtwoord
en vol jeugdig enthousiasme togen we aan het werk Een Erans
bpek vopr de hele klas Geen nood ledere dag stond de nieuwe
les op het bord en de leerlingen kcnden die overschrijven o
En de sohriften dan Die kwamen uit Canada Hetwaren
mooie grote met sneeuw en denneboomplaatjes erop De frereshadden hun medebroeders daar gevraagd ons daarmn te VQorxien
Ook de Franse leesboekjes kwamen uit Canada natuurlijk niet met
Nederlandse maar met Engelse wodrdjes ernaast Je xiet deleer
lingen werden vanzelf knap Het kofa niet anders
De Franse spraakkunst moest je vraeger op bet examen in
het Frans opzeggen Dus werd er iedere zaterdagmiddag een hoofd
stuk in elkaar gezet in het Frans en eenibekwame typiste typte
net zoveel blaadjes uit als de lOe kLas leerlingen bezat Dat
waren er niet zoveel hoorJ Eerst nog eens toen en zo
telkens meer
Nu spreek ik alleon nog maar over het Frans waar het hart
vol van is maar met de andere vakken vvas het net zo Zuster
Magda die pas overleddn is zette een hele dierkunde en mtuur
knndemethodein elkaah Met de tekeningen erbij En maar weer
typen of oversohr ijven Zij heeft zelfs nog eens aan een
cud bibliotheekboek dat zijn levensjaren ook maar steeds moest
verleiigenp en marvan hetdhatste hoofdstuk verdwenen was een
totaal niguw slot bezorgd Dit was ook getypt en werd erin ge
piakt
pns hpofd zuster dlfeletia stenoilde ook veel In het don
ker Nee zp was het niet Je moest aes potdicht maken en dan
mccht je een lamp aansteken als maar niemand vanaf de straat
het lichf kch zien fent je begri jpt s geen vijandelijke duik
boptmocht ietiS op Aruba zien
Over het examen deden we met ongdveer kandidaten zowat
drie dagen iedere dag een paar vakken We namen dan kopjes
mee van het klooster om in de pauze bnzb koffie niei te missen
Ehiahdidaat nu hoofd van de schodl Osl in Boekhoudt was zo
gedienstig om bij zijnmoeder een kete warm water te halen
zodat we alles konden afwassen Ja zo gedienst ig wafen de jon

Ondanks alle tekort aan boeken en leermiddelen slaagden
alle kandidaten Ze werkten dis even hard als ntiJJ Nu zif

Bij gelegenheid van het silveren jutileum van het Maria CoUe
ge zijn we eens met zuster Dorothea gaan praten Hier Tolgt
wat we zoal te weten zijn gekomen
Zuster Dorothea begon tear loopbaan aan het MC in
Zuster Meletia was toen hoofd laar vier jaar later dus in
werd ze zelf hoofd benoemd en re is dat nog
In dienegentien jaar heeft sij ongeveer leerlingen
op school zden komeii Van die leerlingen zijn er twee terugge
komen om hun geliefde zuster bij te staan nl Mevrouw Loper
Henriquez en Mejuffrouw Aida Croes die hu als leraressen aan
die school staan
Een zeer grote steun roor zuster Dorothea is zuster
Alotta die met de school haar zilveren jubileimi daar viert
In die jaar had het Maria College mulokandidaten
Daarvan zijn er maar afgewezen Ze tellen dus geslaag
den maar daar kant dit jaar weer een hele ris bij in
het eerste examenjaar mren er kandidaten die allemaal
slaagden in telde het MC examinandi die ook alle
maal slaagden
Bij de vraag wie haar beroemdste en beruchtste leerlinge
is geweest moest de zuster even lachen Een beroemde voor
wie een monument opgericht zou kunnen worden had ze nog niet
gehad iIaar een beruohte kon ze evenmin noemen
ilen ding waar ze wel zeker van is is dat zij met zeer
veel plezier en voldoening naar de voorbije jaren kan terug
kijken Dat dankt zij ook aan het goede personeel dat zij al
tijd heeft gehad Personeel dat altijd klaar stond voor haar
on voor de belangen van de school
Mj wehsen izuster Dorothea nog vele gelhkkdge jaren toe
temidden van haar gbliefde meisjes en pdraoneeli l

Nu bestaat onze school al jaar waaruit wl blijkt hco
goed onze school is In die bobbin er veel veranderin
gen plants gevonden Neem bv dit blad Vrooger echreven al
leen onze bujorvrindjes en wij laochten het al knikkend goed of
afkeuaren Later mochteinL w echter ons steentje rots bijdara
gen waardoor een goede sainenwerking ontstond
Nog later kregen vie te horen dat er fviiven georganiseerd
zouden rden met onze bimrvr indjes De e n e klas
hadden echter te vroeg gejuicht want zij werden abeoluut niet
ultgenodigdJ J
Ook kregen we mer tijd cm te luieren nln plants van
de weensdagmiddag mogen wiJ de dicLS en donderdagniiddag prins
heerlijk feuisblijven maar tean luieren komt niet veel
In de uitpuilerde tassen kwam geen verschil Misschien dat
ze nu wat dikter iijn mar dnnner net kan ook gijn dat die
tas niet zo dik hoeft te zijn ir alleen wordt volgejropt om
erg geleerd te schijnenJ
Over onze dierbare leraren en leraressen willen we iiele
maal niet klagen Zij waren ht die ons een ohvergetelijkeavond
hebben bezorgd met hun knaltoneelstuk dat zopraentig geslaagd
is Zelfs in de krant stond er een artikel ovef Als deze spe
lers nu maar niet verwaand wordeni Onze complimenten voqr jul
lie ntastisch toneelstuk
Ook het feect dat ons werd gegeven was erg leuk Vocral
de wande lingetjes werden zeer geapprecieerd Dok de lerareni
en leraressenJ liepen reden ons achterna om ons van straf
punten te voerzien fes onze school maar elke dag jrigl fet
zou dat leuk zijnJi
Over onze beroemde school stond er ook een artikel in de
krant Zilveren Jubileum stond er met dikke letters boven
Zelfs een foto ontbrak niet Vfe waren erg trots toen dat alles
zo moo i in de krant prijkte Janmer dat ze diq foto niet van
de achterkant van de school hebben genomen dan kon iedereen
onze twee eigenverdiende ii monsteraircos bewonderen
Zouden de andere soholen dan fijn jaloerswerdeni J
vervol g hiernaast bizIn het Hfefe is al lang zolamg ifeiar
het sdbiijnt dat er its cngoivocns aan de Imnd was De zuetc
zaten vastiii De arme schapen uit de tiende klas die dat jaai
exacien moesten idben zouden helfc moeten stellen zondr Spaans
Zonder een ogenblik te aarzelen kwamen ze bij de freres aan
kloppen Qiridat ze zo goed wistent dat dieQjalle niogelijke
wijien zbuden helpen En als ik nu na zoveel tijd nog wel
eens een van die dames tegejakom dan denk ik nog wel eens
Ja ja die was ook nidt al te best beviriend met het Spaans
Maar er kwam dus de dag dat ikde esrst les zou gven
Zuster Dorothea moet toon pavS hoofd gewcrden zijn en die had
me al van tevoren dringend gewaarschuwd dait er nogal enkele
lastige elemeiateM in dS klas zaten Dus was dubbele waak
zaamheid geboden Nu waren wij op onze school ook wel het eer
en ander gewend wat betreft lestige elementen Daar hoefde
ik me dus niet zo drik over te maken Ivlaar de werkel ijkheid
dvertrof verre de verwachtingen Natuurlijk werd er de eer
ste les hier en daar wel wat gesmoezeld en moest ik met
strehge blik trachten een opkomend onweer te bezweren
iviaar toen ze na die eerste les het huiswerk meekregen vrer
denne wel een beetje bleek onder de neus Ik had namelijk
met een onschuldig gezioht gezegd dat wij vernomen hadden
dat de meisjes zcveel harder werkten dan de jongens en dat
ze ook zoveel pienterder waren dat ik meende dat een flinke
portie huiswerk hen niet alleen geen kwaad kon doen maar
ook zou bevestigen wat wij daar over wisten
EN LAAT ZE NOU DT EUISVyEHK AILElVlAAL KEURIG NETJES AF
EEBBmillllSinds die dag groeide er een aangename sfeer in die klas
Het huiswerk werd stevig aangehoudep en PalabrasV konddn te

Nadat de dagen vandeiiiulQexainen bekend gemaakt waren
wist ik dat mijn verbliji tussen al die lieve kinderen een
einde zou nemen Gelukkigvlaen indie jaren de muloexamens
nog eind juli JJ
Die allenlaatste dag zai ik iiooit laeer vergeten Als naar
gewonnte had ik een zeker stuk in mijn hoofd zitten dat ik als
laatstoj pxmtnpg zounbehandelen Maar daar is in werke li jkhe id
niets vari gekomen iant de lessenaar die was daar veel klel
ner dan dp onze was versierd met allerlei blcempjes uit ei
gen tuin maar zeer smaakvol En voordat Ik van mijn verras
sing kon bekcmen kwam een meis je Maryle in Weaver uit de
ba en begon een leuk speeohje te houden TthArna ze me een
cadeautje pverhandigde in de vorm van een bakje s cheereep
Daarna stond een tweede op ikmeen dat het nevrouw van der
Schoot was die me met een hartelijk woordje ehn etui aan
bood met enkele praohfcig bewerkte zakdoekjes Van mij werd naj
tuurlijk ook een wKrdje merwaoht Hierin bedankte ik hen al
lemaal voor de prettige wijze waarop we dat jar hadden samenl
gewerkt maar dat ik toch hoopte dat ze alLeiiaal zpuden slagen
pmdat ik hetanders niet onaardig sou gevonden hebben hog een
jaartje met hen samente werken als se wilden zakken MAAR
DAT DEDEN ZE ffiETJJJ
Ook voor dejeahpsutjee becjankte JM hen Maar ik kon toch
niet nalaten te vragen vaarom zp juist die dihgetjes hadden
gekocht Warenae miss qhien niet teleniaal tevreden geweest
over mijn scheerkanst zie scheerzeepbakj En vonden ze dat
er met mijniBuc mlsschipn iets niet in orde was geweest zie
sakdoekjes   i I
Hierna was het ofDicieie gedeelte afgelopen en werd de
rest van de tijd doorgebraoht mot het etenvan allerlei lek
kers Gelukkig kon ik in die tijd daar nog volop aan meedcen
Maar achetraf ge zien vind ik het zepr jamner dat het i
maar EEN jaartje geduurd heeft En MJ NOG zou ik willen zeggeni

Ik loop diepdenkend door de Nassaistraat
Waar ik aan denk Ik loop natuurlijk te peinsen
over de VSJvlian die vamiorgen is gelanceerd
ledereen praat erover waarom zou ik er niet over nadenken
Overal hoor je het woord marsmannet je Men vraagt zich alles
af omtrent het marsmanhet je maar men vergeet haar het mars
meisje
Men vraagt zich af of hij echt green is hoe hij er uitziet
en welketaal hi spreeKt enz enz Niemanu denkt eraan dat
hij niet kan bestean als cok die andere niet bestaat het mars

Opeens boor ik een dsn stemmtje ik blijf van schrik
naar de grond staireiiL Ik dmrf niet op te kijken want daar
staat nu vlak bij me nieroand anders dan het marsmeisje
Terwijl ik daar zo sta komt er een ouwe auto piepend en knar
send aan Er is geen twijfel mogelijk dat is de wagen van
onze buurman een uniek geluid nietwaar
Dan dringt het pas tot me doer dat ik op Aruba en notabene in
de Nassaustraat en niet op Mars ben En het dunne steimietje
is natuurlijk van niemand anders dan van Maria het dochtertje
van onze buurman
En het marsmeisje
Ik probeer dat voorlopig uit mijn hoefd te zetten ze heeft
me al genoeg last be zorgd voordat ik haar heb ontmoet

Ouders
Zr M Dorothea op
Wi MariaCollege zegt zegt Zuster Dorothea en omge
keerd Twee namen n begrip Het grootse feest wan janu
ari was daarom ook vooral haar feest Op dat moment wilden
niet realiseren dat die twee namen gescheiden konden
worden Maar dat werd ons pijnlijk duidelijk op februari
m de pauze Op haar geheel eigen manier alsof het een roes
terwijziging betrof vertelde ze dat ze ons ging verlatten
De reacties laten zich gemakkelijk raden een uiting van
de goede onderlinge Samenwerking en waardering voor elkaar en
eikaars werk die op onze school altijd heefp bestaan Zuster
otothea heeft ht altijd als een belangrijke taak gezien
deze goede geest te bewaren en te verdiepen Deze saamhorig
heid manifesteerde zich nog eens duidelijk in het stralende
feest van januari
ok d leerlingen waren zeer onder de indruk van haar
spoedig vertrek vooral de hogere klassen Verschillende
meisjes hebben mij herhaaldelijk verzekerd hoe ze zuster Do
rothea steeds beter leerden kennen wn waarderen naarmate ze
meer het einde van haar opleiding naderden De vele contac
ten met oudleer ingn zijn de bewijzen van hun dankbaar
heid v
Zuster Dorothea we zullen u missen en we weten dat het
bij u ook zo is Uw rustige vrindelijke maar toch zelfver
zekerde wijze van optreden waardoor de hele school draaide
als een soepele machine de tact waarmee u alles wat te hef
tig was wist af te rommen het idealisme waarmee u werkte
voor de toekomst van een jeugd die om leiding vroeg we
hebben het in u bewonderd en zullen het niet gauw vergeten
We zouden u dit alles gezegd hebben op uw feest in
januari wanneer wij van tw afscheid geweien hadden
Eigenlijk zouden we u n van de aircos uit het natuurkunde
lokaal moeten meegeven naar de Bovenwinden als een blijvende
herinnering aan het mooie feest en uw jaren hier aan het Maria
College
Moge het u op Sint Maarten goed gaan en we hopen dat de
goede God u nog veel jaren zal geven om met uw jong gebleven
idealisme te kunnen werken voor een jeugd die u zo na aan het
hart ligt
Hf
Dit jaar zit klas a erg veel te huilen Meneer ST
natuurlijk ook Weet je yaaram Omdat zuster Dorjfthe
Ons gaat verlaten
Ja hocrJ Wij klas a hebben meer dan een zakdoek
nodig om al die tranen te drogen Wij hebben alle
mdal een handdoek op school Iedereen moet dan haar
tranen daaraan afdrogen
H jammer dat zuster Dorothea weggaat Zij heeft
bijna jaar leng hoofdpijn gekregen van alle leer
lingen die daar op school waren en van de leerlingen
die nu op school zijn
We hebben heel veel goeds gekregen van de allerliefste zuster
Wij willen onze grootste dankbaarheid tonen aan haar die zo
veel voor ons gedaan heeft en gewerkt heeft
Zonder haar moeite zouden de vorige leerlingen lang niet alle
maal het diploma gehaald hebben
Dag zuster Dorothea
Vergeet ons niet want wij hebben voor u in ons hartje een
allermooiste plaats bewaard
Daaaaagi En een goede reis

maart gaat zuster Dorothea met verlof naar Nederland
en zal dan het roer van het Maria College voor goed afstaan
aan zuster Helne want na haar Terlof zal ze niet naar Aruba
terugkeren maar op Sint Maarten haar pens ioenjaren doorbren
i i
Graag enkele woorden ten afscheid in ons gezamenlijk
schoolblad Baa di Kwihi
Het is niet z eenvoudig een afscheidswoordje te schrij
ven Zuster Dorothea galmende lof toezwaaien een voorbarige
heiligverklaring ensceneren zeggen dat we haar nooit meer
zullen vergeten nunca di nos bida is lyriek die vrij goed
koop is en niet helemaal eerlijk
Nuchtere feiten opsommen in kwam zij naar Aruba en
en bleef daar tot van augustus tot augustus
was ze werkzaam op de Bovenwinden toen kwam zij naar Aruba
terug en bleef daar tot Anno Domini is schijnbaar juist
maar is in wezen onjuist en onrechtvaardig Immers kanen en
gaan is niets het gaat erom hat is between
En dan zullen allen die zuster Dorothea gekend hebben
graag en vdLmondig beamen ze heeft veel en goed voor de
school haar school zouden we bijna mogen zeggen dat wil
zeggen voor de meis jes van die school gewerkt zowel voorhun
onderwijs als voor hun opvoeding met reden zou men haar Ma
ter honoris causa mogen noemen want enigszins moeder wi e
ze van haar leerlingen toch graag zijn zorgen plannen maken
eens op het matje roe pen
Dat ze nu en dan wel eens het laatste woord van vaderen
moeder wilde hebben daarmee hoeft men het niet eens td zijn
Dat hoorde misschien tot les defauts de ses qualites zoals
ze in Parijs en omstreken zeggen
Zuster Dorothea ik denk en weet eigenlijk wel zeker
al verbergt u uw gevoelens wel een beetje onder uw witte kap
en rustige gelaatstrekken dat u wel wat weemoed zult meedra
gen nu dit alles voorbij is Van de andere kant moet het u
een vreugde zijn te weten wat een mooi werk u hier voor de
mensen van Aruba hebt verricht Dank voor de jarenlange pret
tige samenwerking en het ga u goed Vaarwel Adiosjanuar i

Ook bijhet Rosa College hebben we stom geluks de twee
auto s voor ons stoppen zomaar aan de kant van de weg cm wat
kinderen uit te laten stappen
Onbegrijpelijk dat ze niet midden op de weg stilstaan
Daar zien we het Maria College al
He is dit bolwerk ter verdediging van meisjeseer en i
deugd dan toch gemengd geworden
Is het tenslotte bezweken voor de smekende beden en blik

Och nee bij aandachtiger toekijken blijkt dat de
mannelijke helft van de aanwezige jeugd slechts voor en op
de muur hangt

De afspraak was kwart overzes precies
Maar t is al vijf over half zeven Die broer van mij toch
En het ergste is ik veel me niets op mijn gemak Elke keer
draait die man om mij heen Moet je zien wet een onguur type
o ik kan het haast niet meer uithouden Ik Krijg er ge
woon d kriebel van
Wat moet ik doen Ik kan toch niet weggaan waar
blijft die broer van mij toch Daar komt die kerel op mij af
Hallo liefje heb je misschien een sigaret voor me
Nee nee stotter ik ik heb er geen
Maar zon meisje als jij moet toch een sigaretje hebben Kom
wees niet bang En de man probeert een arm om mij heen te
Laat me los schreeuw ik raak me niet aan Ik ruk me los
en probeer weg ie vlutbteH maar bij is me rocr
Hij gaat voor de deur staan Jij gaat nergens naar toe
hoor Jij blijft hier En wie zie ik daar door her raam
Mijn verloofde ik bid dat hij deze kant uitkomt Mijn
gezicht heeft me al verraden Ik probeer bang en soos te kij
ken Maar de man heeft het al gemerkt Hij draaat zien om en
ziet Alejandro onze kant uitkomenAha dat is zeKer een
vriendje van je nee stotter ik
Kom hier zegt hij en als je n kik geeft zal ik je
mirgen Ik ren om de tafel heen maar hij krijgt me toch te
pakken Hij sleurt me mee achter een gordijn en houdt zijn
vuile hand voor mijn mond Door een kiertje van het gordijn
zie ik Alejandro binnenkomen Hij kijkt rond net of hij iets
zoekt Net als hij weg wil gaan geef ik de man een harde
trap
Hij laat me los en ik vlieg regelrecht in Alejandrosruien Lourdes wat is er aan de hand Aljandre die
man wilde me vermoorden Welke man Die daar
En dan word ik lijkbleek want daar komt die man met een
mes op ons af Alejandro duwt me opzij Laat het maar aan mij
over schat ik weet veelvan judo
De man komt steeds dichterbij Opeens doet hij eenaan
val Alejandro pakt hem bij mijn pols en draait zijn armom
Dan geeft hij hem een heupworp en tenslotte duwt hij hem een
fikse vuist in zijn gezicht De man wankelt even en blijft dan
bewusteloos liggen
Ik hol vlug naar Alejandro toe Heb je je bezeerd
nee schatj ik ben in orde Laten we de politie bellen
Me bellen de politie op Die komt Verklaringen velgen Dan
brengt Alejandro me naar huis en kust me goedenacht
Ik ga naar binnen en wie vind ik daar Mijn broer die
rustig een krant zit te lezen Roberto roep ik uit waar
ben je gebleven
Lourdes ik was het glad vergeten Wil je me vergeven
i
Zonder na te denken heb ik het hem vergeven in plaats
van hem een flinke draai om de oren te geven
Maar n ding heb ik me voorgenomen nooit meer zal ik
ergens op Roberto wachten behalve als er iemand bij me is
die me kan verdedigen

NOODKREET uit c LSC
We hebben dikwijls zon dorst
Me hebben ook wel een kraantje in de klas
Waarom mogen we dan niet drinken
Eindelijk eindelijk is er iemand die mij durft te bekriti
seren Ik vind dat fantastisch
Het is wel een kritiek sin pia y sip cabez Niets waard
Dat jongetje schrijft maar cm te schrijven
Mijn jongetje ten eerste ben ik geen Multatuli maar MENEER
Multatuli en zeker voor jou maar ten tweede moet ik je
gelijk geven omdat je mij een held noemt
Mijn Burketje je zegt dat wat ik schrijf veel geschreeuw
maar weinig wol is maar dat van jou is hopi scuma pero
poco chuulati In pen woord PRUT
Het marsmeisje ik wist niet dat wij op het La Salie College
nog een e klas hadden maar dat is zo Meneer Burketje van
klas F Leuk h
Mijn moeder heeft het Marsmeisje gelezen Toen zij klaar
was vroeg ze mij waarover het ging
Mijn vader begon te lachen want hij dacht dat jijzelf dat
marsmeisje was zo te lezen zou ik het ook denken
Mijn grootmoeder wou het voorlezen aan mijn nichtje maar
zij sliep in want het was zo laf zo laf Ik kan niet
zeggen hoe laf
En mijn broertje van maanden begon in zijn handen te klap
pen toen ik het hem voorlas Hij wou zeggen Net iets voor
mij Nou Burketje je mag wel thuis komen om met mijn broer
tje maanden te spelen hoor Hij zal het zeker leuk vin
den om met jou te spelen En meer verdien je niet
Je hoeft je niet af te vragen hoe zij het marsmeisje eruit
ziet Kijk naar jezelf Niet te groen maar ook niet te rijpJe zit de hele tijd te vertellen dat je eem marsmeisje wilt
zier en als er een vr je staat durf je niet ep tekijken
Dit heb ik niet gefantaseerd dit heb jijzelf gschreven
Je raag wel een goede raad van me krijgen en dat is s Lees je
stukje het marsmeisje nog eens over en gooi het dan astu
blief weg zo ver mogelijk
Maar niet je Bao di Kwihi hoor want dat is veel tegoed Jij
oort niet thuis op het La Salie College want je hebt een
grote mond maar je doet niks
Ik wil niet zeggen dat je niet meer moet schrijven Heus niet
jij schrijft krijgt mijn broertje die dan ondertussen
maanden is geworden iets te lezen wat hij leuk vindt
die is Muitatuli Dit zal wel voor jou een vraag blijven
Een ding kan ik zeggen ik ben een oudleerling van het La
Salie College
En om te eindigen ik lees liever iets over het LaSalie of
het Maria College dan iets dat gaat over een marsmeisje

Beste Abonnees
Het is dan net niet gelukt u dit nummer te bezorgen vr de
vakantie Wij hepen dat u die vrije dagen toch doorgekomen
bent Ging het bij u ook zo vlug
De redaktie dankt alle kopijzenders weer hartelijk en
vraagt voor de maand april de medewerking van vooral de e
klassen Jullie snappen wel dat geen tijd heeft Over
twee weken begint het schriftelijk eindexamen en daar maken
zij zich terechti al heelwat zorgen over Lezers en
redaktie wensen jullie wel heel veel succes
Verder vragen we nog uw aandacht voor de sport in dit num
mer Al moest LVC het zonder aanmoedigingen van me isjes
doen waarom toch MC in beide afdelingen behaalden Onze
jongens de eerste plaats PROFICIAT
Het vliegtuigje een Cesna deed zijn uiterste best om op de
vereiste hoogte te komen  m Je voelde de temperatuur
langzaam maar zeker dalen de ademhaling ging sneller
Ik was op weg naar de Wisselmeren het hartje van kieuw
Guinea nog pas enkele tientallen jaren geleden ontdekt door
Ir Wissel Hier zou ik mijn laatste vakantie in Nieuw Guinea
doorbrengen Ontelbare verhalen waren mij al over dit gebied
verteld en nu had ik de kans de laatste dit nog bijna maag
delijke gebied te kunnen bewonderen
Het toestelletje vloog nu in een pas en passeerde enkele
reusachtige bergketens Plotseling zag ik recht voor me uit
het meer een uitgestrekte waterplas omzoomd door enorme
groene bergen Hoe wonderlijk op ruim m hoogte zofn meer
te zien i
We zakten nu weer en de hoogtemeter wees m aan We
vlogen nog enkele minuten boven het water toen links om een
berg heen en enkele tellen later Zette Eric de piloot van de
Miluva Missie Luchtvaart het kistje veilig aan de grond
Enarotali hoofdplaats district Wisselmeren In tegeretelling
tot de mrneste andere strips welke grasvelden zijn was deze
geasfalteerd een ongekende luxe Later bleek hoe noodzakelijk
dit was Door de enorme regenval zou een grasstrip maar heel
weinig gebruikt kunnen worden Mijn gastheer pater H en en
kele zusters stonden ons al op te wachten Door de radio hadden
ze onze radiocontacten met Biak kunnen horen
De zon scheen fel maar de temperatuur was zalig er woei
een heerlijke koude wind Tegen de heuvels stonden leuke hou
ten huisjes meestal gemaakt van gekapte planken
We namen afscheid van de piloot die nog twee uur vliegen
naar Hol land ia voor de boeg had en begonnen met de wandeling
naar de pastorie TEen kwartiertje lopen zei de pater maar
het is zeker een half uur geworden De pastorie lag op een
heuvel en ik vond het een vreselijke klim Telkens moest ik
blijven staan om op adem te komen ik hijgde als een oud paardI
THoe hoger je komt des fee ijler is de lucht herinner
de ik me uit een aardrijkskundeboek en deze theorie werd nu
wel op een wrede manier in ptaktijk omgezet
Numaakte ik ook kennis met de bevolking de KepaukoTs
Het waren kleine mensjes een soort pygmeen Ze waren zeer
vriendelijk en sommigen stootten een of ander oerwoudgeluid
uit dat dan zoveel als tgoede morgen moest betekenen Een
La Linda was hier kennelijk niet want textiel zag je niet
De vrouwen droegen slechts een rokje van een soort riet ge
ina kt
De pastrie was ook een houten gebouw houten wanden
houten vloeren We dronken wat en gingen eten Tot mijn
grootste verbazing verschenen er aardappels sla en ers
ruhdvlees op tafel Ik kon mijn ogen niet geloven Maanden
lang had ik eigengebakken brood rijst met meatballs uit
blik gegeten soms aangevuld met wat oerwoudgroente De pat
zag mijn verbaasde blikken en zei lachendAllemaal uit ei
gen tuin Ik begreep het hier was een Hollands zomerkli
naat Het smaakte me als ham in de vasten Tijdens de maal
tijd betrok de lucht nis Middags en s nachts regent het
hier praktisch altijd zei de pater en inderdaad binnen
enkele minuten viel de regen met bakken tegelijk uit de luch
De temperatuur daalde ik voelde me steeds kouder worden
Een wollen trui en een paar wollen sokken van de pater deden
echter wonderen Ontzettend slechts graden ten zuiden van
de evenaar en dan deze kleding Na het eten kregen we nog
pudding van verse melk met echte aardbeien Ik was de smaak
ervan al bijna vergeten Na dit heerlijke zalige diner dat
ik mijn leven lang niet meer vergeten zal gingen we slapen
Behaaglijk trok ik een paar wollen dekens over me heen en
viel dadelijk in een vaste slaap
Toen ik wakker werd hoorde ik het zware gedreun van een
dieselmotor naast me Wat kon dat zijn Ach natuurlijk dit
was de elektrische centrale van de pater Nu herinnerde ik
me ook dat er om uur een Mis zou zijn het was immers Twee
de Kerstdag Ik wist niet hoe snel ik me moest aankleden
want het was barkoud
Ik spoedde me naar de kerk ook weer geheel van ruwe
planken genaakt en duwde een van de grote deuren open
Ik stapte binnen en wat ik toen zag deed me werkelijk ver
gaat door op bl
In mijn agenda staat als eersteles Nederlands in a
Met een rij heel kleine jongens ga ik naar boven Hier en
daar steekt er eentje boven de rest uit misschien verdwaald
Maarhij mag blijven Een gezellige klas a ze wandelen graag
naar het bord naar deprullenbak en na ar de kraan Eentje
gaat er zelfs zoveel mogelijk naar het raam Misschien kamt
zijn broertje net voorbij die moet hij dan even goede
dag zwaaien
Spaans kennen ze hier goed Bij het laatsteCP gaf
iemand de volgende vertaling El muclinchc leva una gorra
grande s da jongen brengt een grotegorillai
De bel gaat en ik zou graag een helieopter hebben cm de
langste afstand op onze school watvlugger te kunnen afleggent
van a naar Sa
a lijkt wel wat op a er wonen heel wat gezellige klets
kousen Bovendien zitten er ook oude bekenden vande e klas
Endaarvan we zullen hem Xnoemen het is toch algebrales
heeft nog dezelfde gewoonte als vroeger hij geeft zichzelf
af en toe een dagje vrij
Die aqhtste klassen kennen toch wel beter Spaans dan
Wat denk je bv van de vo lgende zin bei meisje had rode lip
pen t la muchacha tenia los lapices rojosJ
Een echte wiskundeklas is d Ze werken er vooral graag
met onbekenden Y maakt achter op het bord een tekening Die
tekening bestaat uit snijdende lijnen en cirkels en stelt een
onbekende leraar voorVerder zijn er jongens onbekend met het feit dat bij
meetkttnde passer gradenboog edm behoren
De liefde tot de algebra gaat zelfs over op het kiezen
van namen Een van de leerlingen heet zo Tenkwadraat ipv
Tenten
Die les is ook al weer voorbij Op naar c Daar zit
ten ze al met smart te wachten Iedereen heeft zijn Spaans
boek op de bank Alle kawwgumknauwers hebben hun mond leeg
gemaakt Op de trap hcor ik al hoe muisstil ze zijn en
merk ik al dat er niemand is gaan drinken
Ik zit hier wel niet een moeilijkheid Over een maand
moet ik een van de jongens van c naar sturen want hij
heeft ongeveer alle bibliotheekboeken van al gelezen
misschien zou hij nou wat meer aandacht aan zijn zwakke vak
ken kunnen gaan geven
uur tijdvoor wat ontspanning
In bovenstaande overpeinzingen zit en fout die hem
vindt kan bij ondergetekende een bonnetje krijgen dat is
dan geldig voor en keer geen strafwerk of een keer geen
huiswerk

deed me werkelijk verstenen Hoe lang ik daar zo gestaan heb
weet ik niet maar het moeten minuten geweest zijn
Ik zag honderden KepaukoTs de meesten stonden daar het
evangelie werd voorgelezen links de vrouwen en kinderen
rechts de mannen Textiel was ook hier niet te bespeuren Het
gebouw was gevuld met geschreeuw van babys en kleuters ge
jank van honden die overal onder de banken lagen ja zelfs van
een biggetje dat een der vrouwen in een net op haar rug had
meegenomen Taltijke moeders waren druk bezig hun zuigelingen
te voeden en boven al dit lawaai uit het evangelie voorgele
zen door de pater
Mijn reukorgaan werd beslist niet gestreeld Er hing een
penetrante stank Met luid kabaal ging de menigte weer zitten
nu kon ik de pater op het altaar zien en ik zag nu ook een
kerststal Mijn God dit was nummissie Ook deze mensen nog
maar net uit het stenen tijdperk vierden Kerstmis
Ik slofte naar voren ging zitten op iets dat een bank
leek en wreef in mijn ogen nee ik droomde niet ik was op
bezoek bij de Kepaukos

SRoosDE BEKEERDE ZOON
Juan Alvarez was de oudste van drie zonenj en zoals de
meeste Mexicanen zeer vroom katholiek Maar er kwam een grote
verandering in Juans leven Dat gebeurde toen hij zestien was
Zijn vader een brave man werd op weg naar de kerk door een
auto overreden Zonder zijn familie nog jfe kunnen spreken
sti rf hij
Door de dood van zijn vader moest Juan stoppenmet zijn
studie en gaan werken want zijn moeder verdiende niet genoeg
bij de wasserij om hem en zijn twee broers te onderhouden Dit
alles werkte mee om Juan helemaal te veranderen
Hij ging nooit meer naar de kerk en de ene vloek na de
andere rolde uit zijn mond God bestaat niet hield hij maar
niet op te schreeuwen en als hij bestaat kent Hij toch gen
re chtvaardigheid
Juans moeder en broers bleven zeer gelovig
Zo gebeurde het op een Goede Vrijdag enkele jaren later
d t zijn moeder hem weer broeg mee naar de kerk te gaan Juan
wol erde als altijd Toen moeder en broers weg waren nam Juan
do krant en begon aandachtig te lezen Eben later tegen drie
uur werd het een beetje donker Juan stond op en keek naar
buiten Regen was er niet op komst Hij vond het een beetje
vreemd maar ergerder er zich niet over Hij stak de lamp aan
en ging door met lezen
Even later viel er een vlek op de krant Toen Juanzag
dat het bloed was schrok hij zich dood Meteen viel er een
tweede vlek Juan keek omhoog en zag dat het kruisbeeld dat
boven hemhing bloedde
Hij viel op zijn knien en smeekte God om vergiffenis voor
zijn ongeloof Toen kleedde hij zich vlug aan en liep naar ie
kerk Hij vertelde zijn moeder allee wat er gebeurd was Namen
dankten ze God voor dit teken
Vanaf deze dag was de familie weer helemaal verenigd
e hBijhet lezen van het stukje mr multatuli in het vo
rige nummerj moest ik wel lachen om de vele stommite iten die
er instonden Natuurlijk heb ik het uitgelezen can er nu een
beetje op aan te merken
Multatuli geeft me gelijk dat ik hem een held op sokken
noem Een held maakt geen gebruik van een pseudoniem
Multatuli vindt mijn verhaal en kritiek nhopi scuma pero
poco chuculati Ik vind zijn antwoord PURO SCUMA er
zit helemaal geen chuculati bij
Ik vind dat je je ouders er niet bij moet halen als je mij
nog eens durft tegen te spreken Je schrijft dat je moeder
mijn verhaal niet begrepen heeft je broertje wel rara
Je vader dacht dat ik het marsmeisje was Jongens en meis
jes uit elkaar houden kan hij misschien niet omdat jij zn
zoon bent je kletst teveel
Ook beweer je dat je nichtje in slaap viel want het was
zo laf zo laf Je bedoelt zeker saai Laf is eeri ka
raktertrek bv van jou
Je schrijft dat ik me niet meer hoef af te vragen hoe het
marsmeisje eruit ziet Dat doe ik ook niet meer J ik heb
haar onlangs gezien hangend over een muur van het MC
ze hee t J oy Harms
Als ik schrijf heeft je broertje dat maanden oud is
iets te lezen Ha ha ha Eenjongen van maan
den die kan lezen is op deze wereld iets bijzonders Hij
is natuurlijk het marsmannetjemag gooien maar Het marsmeisje vind je prut Dan is
Bao di Kwihi ook prut als mijn verhaal goed genpeg is om
erin geplaatst te worden
Wie is Multatuli
Dat is dank zij jouw grote mond geen moeilijke vraag meer
Het antwoord is Joy Harms het marsmeisje
Harms je ik raad je aan cm nooit meer een verhaal te bekrit
seren zoals je Het marsmeisje hebt bekritiseerd want je V
zult van een koude kermis thuis komen lees s op Mars terugkren
Om te eindigen ik lees liever iets dat gaat over het c
het LSoCo dan iets dat geschreven is door Multatuli

De jongens van Cedrie hebben het
lijker gehad Zij hebben er veel
heel wat moei
harder voor moe
ten vechten Maar het is gelukt Gefeliciteerd Probeer de
laatste wedstrijd nog te winnen En dan nog tegen de kampioen
van San Nicolaas de ATS Succes daarmee
Het is wel even sukkelen geweest met de geblesseerde keepers
maar met een sterke achterhoede als ze allemaal op tijd komen
krijgt de keeper het echt niet zo druk
We rekenen weer op veel toeschouwers voor de laatste wedstrijd
en voor de finalesHet gebeurt vaak dat tante Miep ons allerlei verhaal
tjes over vroeger vertelt Deze had ze meestal van Oma ge
hoord toen ze nog klein was en bij haar op de schoot zat
Deze keer vertelde ze een verhaal dat echt gebeurd was met
haar broer
Ome Jan was toen ongeveer jaar oud Hij ging dikwijl
naar de bar in de buurt en als hij naar huis kwam was het
mmestal al een uur of drie in de nacht Oma had hem dikwijls
daarvoor gewaarschuwd want naar men zei dwaalde daar in
de buurt de ziel van een gierige koopman rond Jagers die
van de jacht thuis kwamen beweerden hem gezien te hebben
Maar ome Jan wilde er geen geloof aan hechten en zei dat
het allemaal fantasie was en bijgeloof Die gedachte kwam
hem duur te staan
Op een nacht ging hij zoals gewoonlijk tegen drie en
naar huis Opeens hoordehij het gehuil van een klein kind
Hij draaide zich om maar zag niets Het geluid liet zich
weer horen En deze keer zag hij het Midden op de weg zat
een jongetje Ome Jan ging naar hem toe en vroeg wie hij
was o Het knaapje opende zijn mond en er kwam vuur uit Op
zijn hoofd had hij twee horentjes en zijn handen en voeten
leken op bokkepootjes Bij het zien van dat alles begon ome
Jan te rennen maar struikelde en viel
De volgende morgen vond boer Bietsen hem daar bewuste
loos liggen Hij bracht hem naar Oma Bea de meid bracht
hem weer bij met de geur van koeiemest
Later vertelde hij alles wat hij gehoord en gezien had
Uit schrik voor dit alles ging hij niet meer naar die
bar maar richtte er zelf eentje op
Lucyweer dat moeilijke nederlands nu van het lsc
uit een godsdienstproefwerk in de pass iet ijd
Jij was ook in de olijf tij hem
Met zijn kleren werd gedobbeld
Jfezus had dorst en toen stak een soldaat een spons met
azijn in zijn hart
Judas kreeg tweelingen
Een groep Geallieerde weenvrouwen

Eli Eli sabata mi
Elli Elli kan en haal mij
Wie willen jullie hangen Jezus of Barrabas
Er werd een wacht geplaatst omdat men dacht dat Maria en

Ze gaven hem azijn met een stukje spons
Die twee naast mij weten niet wat ze doen

resepct voor de redacbie van aan schoolblad dab nieb na drie
keer versdhijneneen onbijdig einde vindb
Ga zo doorJ Hoe rneer leerlingen er iebs in sphri jven
des be meer heanbwoordb heb aan zijn doel i
Maar nu willen jullie vatn MTJ iebs horen Je begrijpb
dab k in die korbe bijd nog geen geftndeerd cordeel heb en
ooknieb durf be geven over de AruTtaanse jongelui Hoewel i
heel veel dingen lijken jullie sprekend op de sbuderend jon
gens en meisjes in Nederland Nabuurlijk horen jull ie wel
eens wab van vrienden en vrlendinnen die naar Nederland ijh
gegaan voor hun sbudie Ze zuilen je zeker over de leuke as
pecben schrijven Maar vergeeb nieb dab ze ook flink moeben
aanpakken Als je iebs wili bereiken waar dan ook dan mceb
je werken Heb is begrijpelijk dab je bijdenseen lang bri
uibzieb naar een welverdiende vakanbie En nu ben ik
op heb punt aangeland waar ik je iebs over wilde verbellen
xn
Als heb Pasen geweesb is beginb iedereen plannen be ma
ken voor de grobe vakanbie Heb is fijn on meb klasgenoben er
eens helemaal een of bwee we ken uibtT be zijn Dab gaab dan
nieesbal op de fiebs Maar ja vakanbie houden daar heb je
geld voor nodig Nu moeben jullie echb nieb denken dab de
papafs wel in hun porbefeuille duiken voor zoon of dochber
lief Nee dab is er echb nieb bij Gelukkig maar Nu moeben
ze zelf dab nodige geld verdienen en dan is de vakanbie daar
na eens zo zoeb Vlak voor de grobe vakanbie beginb is xeder
een druk bezig cm een geschikb baanbj be soeken Er is zo
Veel werk waar je echb nieb geschoold voor behcefbbe zijn
Meisjes sbaan bv bwee of drie weken in een winkel Ze helpen
ook wel bij heb fruib plukken en scrberen Je denkb waar
schijnlijk en fruib eben Dab zal ook wel eens gebeuren
maar ze worden bebaald voor elk rnandje kersen of aardbeien
dab ze plukken Anderen gaanvoor fabrieken groenbe of fruib
schoonmaken De blikken vinden daarna hun weg bob op Aruba
boe Ik heb hier benminsbe pobben jam gezien uib Tiel Juisb
in de zomermaanden werken deze fabrieken onder hoogspanningvoor de export Dan heb je ook wel eens lets gehoord ever de
bloembollen En over Keukenhcf Dat is een stuk bos mar de
bloembollenf irmas ieder de eigen gekweekte tulpen hyacinthen
narcissen en andere bolgewassen laten zien Het is een weelde
voor het oog Maar er moet heel wat gebeuren voor de bollen
net jes verpakt klaar liggen om naar alle werelddelen verzon
den te worden Aan een bol die zojuist uit de grond is gekomen
zitten worteltjes enklisters die eraf moeten blen kan dan
ook heel wat vlugge handen gebruiken om de bollen te pellen
En ik kan je verzekeren dat je op moet schieten om een hele
mand klaar te krijgen Want je werdt weer betaald vpor ie
dere mand die je exportklaar aflevert
Jongens werken soms op de stations om te helpen bij het
verzenden van goederen e werken ook in garages of ze onder
houden tuinen van rijke zakenlieden Ook meisjes die in een
zomerpension helpen om de gasten van koffie en thee van brood
en warme maaltijden te voorzien Het klinkt heel mooi maar
het is gewoon dienstmeisje spelen
Ja en mt verzinnen ze al nietc Je kunt bv de huisdie
ren verzorgen van lui die een maand naar het buitenland gaan
De jeugd is vindingrijkc Ze zijn ook echb niet bang voor
een paar vuile handen ifant je begrijpt natuuilijk wel dat er
voor jongelui die drie weken komen werksn en daarna weer ver
dwijnen echt niet het prettigste werk blijft liggen
Maar het vakantiegeld komt zo bij elkaar
Toch vind ik dat er buitendit ook andere positieve kanten aan
zitten Ze ervaren eens hoe vele mensen dagelijks in de weer
zijn voor het algemeen welzijn Ze voelen zeif hoe vermoeiend
dit is Er groeit beslist meer waardering voor het werk dat
I met handen gedaan wordt Sans maken de jongens of meisjes al
vast kennis met het bedrijf vaar ze later willen gaan Terken
Deze jongelui tenen in elk geval dat ze de fut hebben hm iets
te doen Ze zouden ook kunnen rondslenteren en minachtend kij
ken naar de aannen die ons huisvuil ophalen de straat schoon
houden of in de haven het zware werk doen
Vferken is niet iets waar je minachtend tegenaan moet kij
ken omdat jij toevallig hebt kunnen studeren
Werken is zalig is een oud gezegd Je moet maar eens
bij elkaar zoeken hoeveel uitdrukkingen er in de Nederlandse
taal leven die een uitdrukking zijn van dit stuk volkswijs

Aruba heeft een mooie toekomst voor zich
In de toekomst kunnen de Arubanen ervoor zorgen dat er trei
nen gaan rijden over het eiland
Iedereen zal rijk zijn want met heeft drie grote goudaders
gevonden in de mijnen van Pontono
Over een paar eeuwen zullen we niet meer op een fiets
of brcmfiets rijden maar in een vliegtuigje cirkelen Dan
staan er een stuk xof res vliegtuigen in de hangar bij elk
huis Een voor elk lid van het gezin Rijbewijs is niet meer
nodig Minimum leeftijd ook niet
Er zullen geen scholen meer zijn want als moeder In ver
wachting is slikt ze een pil die verstand geeft om dokter te
worden en de baby die geboren wordt wordt dokter Er zijn
natuurlijk allerlei soorten pillen
In de toekomst gaat men een kunstijsbaan aanleggen in
het stadionr In plaate van voetballen kun je dan midden in
een tropisoh klimaat waar nog nooit een vlokje sneeuw ge
vallen is gaan schaatsen
On naar Curagao te gaan hoef je geen passage meer te
kopen Curagao is onze buurman Je kunt een enkele re is ko
pen om de maan te gaan leren kennen maar je kunt niet terug
want er gaan geen raketten van de maan naar Aruba Wei van
de maan naar China Maar het kost te veel om van China naarAruba te komenj daarom blijven de Arubanen lever op de maan
De geleerden op Aruba zijn bezig met het maken van een
raket naar de zon Maar er zijn geen piloben die naar de zon
willen gaan want daar is het een beet je warmer dan op Aruba
en op de maan
Ook zal er een Drivintheater komen op Aruba maar niet
voor autos maaryoor familietre inen
Er zullen ook geen oorlogen meer gevoerd worden want
Aruba heeft een bom die heel de were Id kan verwoesten en
daar cm kijkt iedereen wel uit
Nu wil men tlet jets gaan vliegen op Aruba maar de pas
toor wil het niet hebben want dan gebeuren er nog veel meer
ongelukken en de pastoor kan het dan niet bijhouden met mis
sen lezen voor de overledenen
Aruba is een miljoeneneHand geworden Er ijn nu al een
stuk of tien wolkenkrabbers op Noord en op Savaneta maar in
de stad warden ze niet gebouwd want telkens als er een vlieg
tuig tegen botst valt zofn huizenblok om cm dat dan weer
Gvreind te zetten kost een heleboel geld
Zo zie ik de toekomst van ArubaExamenopolis
Als je al vele jaren de muloexamens hebt meegemaakt
niet als kandldaat natuurlijk nfaar als belangstellend toe
schouwer want helpen mag en kun je niet dan weet je wel wat
er zeal kan gebeuren en komen er geen verrassingen meer be
halve natuurlijk in het examenwerk self Soms is het moei
lijker dan je al vreesde of ook wel eens makkelijker dan je
verwachtte
De kandidaben visten dat ze een kantlijn moesten trek
ken en op we Ike geografische lengte  dat ze hun
naan niet boven het werk mochten schrijven sat was om de een
of andere min of meer duistere reden heel erg Nee ge kreeg
een kodeletter en een kodecijfer En dat was jij nu al
wist de Burgeylijke Stand en Bevolking er niets van
c
Ook wist je dat je eigenlijk zelf voor schr ijfbehoef ten
moest zorgen behalve dan het papier Maar om een volkstoe
loop bij het schoolmagazijn te voorkomen werden al jaren
lang potlood gum passer en liniaal ter beschikking gesteld
dai was je van all e rompslomp af Wel moest je een vijftal
ballpoints geve chtsklaar houden ais mogelijk een of ander
van die moderne spuitjes een flat tire kreeg
En zo zijn er nog meer van die kleinigheidjes die niets
met het examenwerk zelf te maken hebben maar die toch no dig
zijn voor een vlot verloop Tot en met kwamen hierbij
praktisch nooit verrassingen of problemen voor zorgde
echcter wel voor interessante  verrass inkjes
le dag dinsdag aprils le verrass ings toen de blaad
jes van vier lokalen verzameld en gerangsehikt werden ble
ken er twee kandidaten nurrmer X te hetfoen ivie echt num
mer X had was gauw gevonden De kandidaten waren al weg
Na wat zoeken werd het hardschrift van de ander herkend en
de nummervervalser werd opgebracht ja toch hij gaf toe
zijn nummer was niet X maar X ja nu was hij er zekevan hij kon het wel niet zwart cp wit bewijzen want zijn
rooster lag thuis xnaar het was tooh absoluut zeker ze
woensdag april Nee nu zou zoln verrassing wel niet
gebeuren het was immers de Bdag en dat waren van die exacte
accurate jongelui iets dergelijks was uitgesloten Toch waren
er weer twee met hetzelfde nummer Z Dit was vlugger opge
lost daar het aantal Bers kleiner was Maar de toezicht
houders en anderen begonnen zich af te vragen Hoe is zoiets
toch mogelijk Wat zou de oorzaak zijn Zouden de getallen
bcven de daar letstaee te maken hebben Nee dat leek tooh
al te mal Of zouden er zon merkwaardige ktapen tussen zit
ten Ja hoe was dit te verklaren Een meende dat het een
kwestie van psychischo identif icatie was Nee die woorden
hoef je op de mulo nog niet te kennen maar het komt hierop
neer als iernand dikwijls het nummer van een andere kandidaat
ziet of Tooral van een kandidate dan gaat hij dat als zijn
nummer beschouwen zeals iemand die veel ever Napoleon leest
op de duur als hij daar een zekere aanleg voor heeft ziph
als een Napoleon IV kangaan beschouwen Je ziet wel het
klinkt geleerdj of het ook nog waar is is natuurlijk een an
dere kwestie h
e dag donderdag april Wel natuurlijk de gebruike
lijke verrassingen Engels datmeeviel en de duidelijke
hulp die de opgave zelf gaf om te ontdekken dat pruik in
het Engels wig is en dat orkestbak wel orchestra pit
most zijn en algebra dat op het eerste gezicht leuk en niet
moeilijk werk leek maar toch weer tegenviel als je eenmaal
aan het kluiven was Maar geen dubbele nummers
Toch was er weer iets een kandidaat ontbrak om uur
Opgebeld en jawel hoort vliegensvlug werd hij met de auto
aangevoerd doodnuchter merkbe hij op dat hij in slaap geval
len was wel een bewijs Me wermoe iend zofn dagen zijn
Ik ben benieuwd wat de laatste dag zal brengen Maar
laat ik dit vers lagje ran deze merkwaardige maar onbelang
rijke ervaringen maar gauw naar het bureau Tran BdK brengen

tJa hoor ik ben weer terug maar toch met hetzelfde doel
De vorige keer toen fr Paulus deeerste vipol speelde had
ik een stukje geschrevens Waarom niet
Ik had daarin gevraagd cm een kerstvier ing
een sinterklaasvier ing en een waterkoeler Ik
had geluk want er werd iets gedaan met sinter
klass en we kregen een kerstvier ing
Yclgens fr Paulus was hij allang van plan
kerstmis met ons te vieren Maar so kanhet na
tuurlijk nooitwezen want dan zou ik zijn ge
dachten kunnen lezen en als ik dat kon zou xk
de ze gave bij PVv gebruiken
Maar enfin fr P speelt de eerste viool

Hij stelde zich voor en maakte beleefd de achterdeur van
de auto open maar de meisjes hielden hem tegen en deden de
deur weer dicht
Toen maakte de oudste de chauffeurs deur opeh en meneer
mocht instappen Ze gingen toen beiden voor in de wagen smit

voor de dokter
Ze kwamen heel thuis De oudste bleek Miriam te heten en
de andere Jaan Miriam vertelde haar moeder dat ze op het
eerste gezicht al dolverliefd was geworden op dokter Peter
Jaan zei niets Ze was wel enigszins jaloers maar ze liet
het niet merken
Toen Ee gegeten hadden belde Miriam meteen Peter op
Tot haar teleurstelling nodigde de dokter beiden uit om die
avond naar een gezellige club te gaan Ze waren daar beiden
natuurlijk wel voor te vinden

A maandenlang zie je elke dag jongens voor eh na school
en onder de speeItjden rommelen in de natuurkundeklas
Ze broeden grootse plannen urt die naarmate de tijd voor
bijgaat dikwijls wat vers chrompelen Sammige zeer fraaie plan
nen zijn zi geheim dat niemand er nog ooit lets van te horen
of te zien krijgt Daar hebben we oprechte bewondering voor
Een paar kerels echter blijven strijden ze hebben lets
bedacht en voeren dat uit De ene dag errthouciast de volgen
de dag opgejaagd maar er kornt heel langzaam iets te voor
schijn We moeten wel betreuren dat we geen ambachtss chool
afdeling aan het La Salle College hebben want handvaardig
heid en vingervlugheid zijn niet onze beste kwaliteiten
Eoch wil een paar uitgevoerde plannen even voordragen

Gretahad geduldig geluisterd naar de onderwijzer die
de ifre je s in de klas uitgelegd had wat ze aHemaal aan het
tafeltje voop Nederlands konden verwachten Haar boekenlijst
had ze good bestudeerd all een kwam een persocn uit het ene
boek wel eens in een ander boek cpduiken Fen kniescor die
daar op let
Nederlands was haar eerste tafeltje Dapper zcht ze op
de plattegrcnd en na Spanje en Frankrijk kwam ze eindelijk in
Nederland Maar het bleek het verkeerde Nederland te zijn Ge
schiedenis was altijd moeilijk vcor haar geweest Een behilpzame geest leidde haar naar de juiste tafel en gaf haar een
boekje met verhaaltjes zei iets tegen haar wees naar een
stoel aan de kant en ging zelf zitten Greta liep in de aan
gewezen richting en keek naar het boekje Wat meet ik daar
mee doen dacht ze en keek naar een rijtje jongens en meis
jes die ock een boekje hadden en zaten te lezen Ock Greta be
gon te lezen op de opengeslagen bladzijde
Teen ze geroepen werd had ze het verhaaltje bijna uit en
dacht nog gauw evens Ik hoop mar dat ze me over Het Hofke
vragen Op de vraag hoe ze heette antwoordde ze prompts Marie
Koenen De veibaasde gezichten van de examinatoren deden haar
vermoeden dat ze iets verkeerds had gedaan en bijna had ze
Milia gezegd maar nog net op tijd realieerde ze zich dat
ze de vraag niet gehoord had
Na dit misverstand mooht ze het verhaaltje voorlezen
Gelukkig was het hetzelfde stukje wat ze zojuist gelezen had
en niet dat lange op die andere bladzijde ernaast Ze lar het
goed en Greta begon zich rustiger te voelen
Toen die ene meneer begen te vragen en de andere te schri
ven wist ze ineens heel helder dat haar examen begonnen was
De antwoorden kwamen vlot en duidelijkc Nog even zat ze te
stuntelen met haar gedicht toen ze na het eerste couplet al
meteen aan het laatste teg on
Gelukkig mocht ze daarna verteilen ever die lieve Milia
die stoute Thllde en die knappe Willem
Toen stapte Greta vol goede moed naar het tweede tafeltje
HJa de strijd tussen Multatuli en FBurke is spannend
Multatuli is boos omdat Burke hem of haar het marsmeisje
r oemt
Waarom he eft Multatuli niet eerder geschreven Volgens
mij is hij bang Hij durfde niet laser te schrijven en Burke
wachtte op antwoord
Burke moet weer schrijven Dat vind ik gced Hij is niet
bang niet zo bang als Multatuli het marsmeisje Mr Kurjaki
je bent net een gedresseerde aaps Je stee kt telkens je staart
in andermans zaken Weet gaat het jou nou aan wat Multatuli en
Burge uitspoken Laat ze hun gang gaan laat ze de bcel maar
kort en klein slaan
Bao di Kwihi weet hoe ze die stukken moet behandelenj zij
keuren de verhalen toch eerst Dat is hun werk Dat weet ik
van een redaktielid Dus blijf thuis met je verhalen mr Kur
jaki We hebben echt geen raadgever nodig Ineen blad moet
toch van alles staan Waarom mogen ze elkaar niet bekritise
ren Dat maakt het blad veel levendiger
Het blad is voor alle meisjes en jcngens van Maria en Da
Salle College Als er iets ingestuurd wordt dat niet door de
beugel kan dan moet de redaktie dat weten Die zee ken het
wel uit Dus Mr Kurjaki ik raad je aan blijf thuis en laat
ze maar door gaan

Goede avond dames Miriam had Peter al bij de hand en
leidde hem naar binnen Mevrouw Jansen kwam natuurlijk ook een
woordje zeggen Peter was opgewekt en mevrouw Jansen merkte dal
heel goed Maar Jaan zat verdrietig in een hoekje en keek als
maar naar de hand van Miriam die die van Peter vasthield
Peter merkte het en hij stond op en zei dat het al laat
was Mevrouw Jansen bracht hen naar de deur Miriam jing na
tuurl ijk naast Peter zitten in de autc
De club was niet ver Peter stapte uit en knipoogde naar
Jaan Dat moest haar toch overtuigen dat er niks was tussen
Peter en Miriam De club was zeer romantisch ingericht Elek
trisch licht brandde er niet Bij het binnenkomen al snoven
ze de geur van de kaar sen
Ze zochten een mooi plaafeqje vlak bij de deur Peter wil
de iets bestellen toen de band met de eerste nummers begon
Miriam had Peter al bij de hand en vroeg uitdagend of hij met
haar wilde dansen Bet waw moeilijk voor Peter om nee te zeg
gen maar Jaan zag hierin toch een duidelijk bewijs
Jaan bleef rustig zitten Na de eerste vier nummers hield
de band even op Peter stuurde Miriam expres naar de bar om
wat drinken te halen zodat hij gelegenheid zou hebben om even
met Jaan alleen te praten Maar Jaan zei geen woord
Toen nam Peter een besluit Hij vroeg Jaan of zij met
hem wilde omgaan Jaan keek hem recht in de ogen en zei
Gaat door
REWODe duisternis began te vallen
De wind waaide zachtjes om het schip dat zich op de grote
wateroppervlakte be vend Zover je maar zien kon was alles wa
iter en nog eens water
Aan toord was alles kam en bijna alle matrozen zaten of
lagen in hun kooien Alleen de regelmatige voetstappen van de
kapitein verbraken nu en dan de stilte
Terwijl ik op bed over de afgelopen dag lag na te den
ken viel ik in een dibpe slaap Ik had nog geen goed uur ge
slapen teen ik de kapiteip hoorde sohreeuwen rtDoe je zwem
gordel am en wees voorbere id cp het ergste
Ncg halfdronken van de slaap deden wo wat de kapitein
had bevolen De regen kletterde neer op het dek en het schip
begon vervaarlijk te slingeren Eu pas be gen het tot me door
te dringen dat er storm cp til De golven werden gewel
dig groot en deden het schip zo enorm slingeren dat het leek
cf dit een wilde dans uitvoerde
Dr heerste paniek aan boordj enkele matrozen werden bij
het uitvoeren van commando Ts overboord gesleurd door de woes
te schuimende gclven waar ze hun graf vonden
De stem ban de kapitein weergalmde weer door de micro
foonsTWees rustic bl ijf kalm em  t zijn zin werd afgebro
ken De kapitein was er niet meer om zijn bevelen te geven
dij was cp een mysterieuze manier verdwenen
Niemand wist wat er nu gedaan moest worden Bet zweet
parelde cp mijn voorhoofd Grote angst was in onze ogen te
lezen enbnze lippen bewogen wel maar er kwam geen geluid
uit onze kelenEnkele matrozen besloten tenslotte in zee te springen om
so te proberen zwemmend zichzelf te redden Maar dit werd hen
evenzeer noodlottig Plotseling voe lde ik een hevige schok
het schip knapte als een luciferstokje Ik kreeg een dreun van
een eind hout op mijn hoofd en wist toen geen sikkepit meer
Langzaam ontwaalcte ik waar was ik
Alles vts nog donlcer het was alsof iemand op mijn hoofd zat
te hameren Langzaam ging ik overeind zitten al mijn ledema
ten deden vreselijk pijn en mijn lichaam was bedekt met open
gereten wonden Plotseling wat was dat
Daar fonkelden twee ogen in de duisternis ik probeerde
te vluchten maar kwam niet ver Twee stappen vender kwam ik
met mijn hoofd tegen een flinke kei aan Toen was alles weer
een en al duisternis
Toen ik eindelijk weer ontwaakte lag ik in een praohtig
bed waarnaast een lief meisje stond Ze vertelde me dat ik
speed ig weer thuis zou zijn Ik moest aan mijn makkers blijven
denken die op zee hun dood hadden gevonden Ik werd uit mijn
gepeins opgeschrikte toen de deur openging en een man met een
baard lang als die van vader Abraham binnentrado het ms
de dokter
Qm mijn pijn te verlichten gaf hij mij een morfinespuitje
Toen ik weer wakker werd stond moeder naast mijn bed

maar jij bent nog stamuer cm re te gel even Ik heb niet gezegd
dat ik een held ben dat heb jij geschreTeru En ik rind dat jij
gelijk hebt
Tk maak gebruik van een psoudoniem all een maar voor de lol
Op het La Salle College weet iedcreen wie Multatuli is en op
het teria College ok Jij was de enige stommeling die niet
wist wie Malta fciili wasc Met be hulp van mijn grote mond ben jij
er achter gekomen wie ik ben Mu ik heb mijn mons gemeten en
die is precies mu
Als ik mijn ouders erbij haal gaat het jou niets aan en
men hoeft zeker geen durf te hebben om jou te bekritiseren Jij
hebt wel durf nodig om zo Tn prut verhaal als het Marsmeisje te
publiweren
Bij nummer had je wel gelijk dat was mijn fout Maar ik
ben nog geen professor in de Nederlandse taal Ik heb altijd ge
hoord dat jongens naar meisjes kijken en me is jes naar jongens
so nu en dan Jij ncemt mij het marsmeisje omdat ik naar de
meisjes sta te kijken bij het Maria College Wel wat moet
ik jou dan noemen om bij het La Salle College naar de mannen te
kijken Ben je misschien te mooi om naar de meisjes te kijkenife juffrouw Burke durft niet naar de me is jes tejkijken
Je zegt dat ikte laf ben Mijn mening s ikben laf orn
dat ik jou bekritiseer zoTn klein schijnhe ilig ding Jij
hoeft mij niets aan te raden ikweet wel wat ik deen meet
Je hebt twee bladzijden van Bac di Kwihi gevuldk inaar ge
bruik astublief de vclgende keer eigen woorden
Alles wat ik schrijf schrijf jij ock maar natuurlijk om
gekeerd zodat het in jcuw vccrdeel komt te liggen Nu zal ik
even gebruik maken van jcuw woorden Burnet je s ik raad je aan
cm nooit meer Mr kultatuli te bekritiseren want je zult van
een koude kermis thuiskomen lees cp het kerkhof kemen te
liggen Ik gel oof dat je bang bent Hoef niet hoor ik eet je
he us nie t op
De titel van dit stukje is voor de laatste keer Multatu

maar niet de laatste keer dat ik lets voor Bao di Kwihi
schrijf Mijn vrieilden hebben mij aangeraden mijn fiijd niet

Alles publiceren svp

Dat hebben we dan gedaan Roland al is dit laatste artikel
volgens de redaktie I geschreven door MultatulaWe zaiben alien in sofaTs met hele zachte donzige kussens
En de onderwijzer op een divan Naast elke sofa staat een ijs

De klas is helemaal van glas zodat iedereen naar buiten

De schriften worden uitgedeeld
door twee ijzeren armen die achvf
ter in de klas aan de muur zitten
Na elk lesuur krijgen we een kwartier pauze dan kunnen we
iets uit cns ijskastje nemen en een krcketje of zo braden
Als het kwartier om is piept er een doosje dat naast je op
de sofa ligt Dat doosje is wel een beetje vervelend wantLi II
herb piept te Teel iiet piept als je praat als je Toorzet
of als je iets anders zit te doen dan op te letten Geleerd
moet er wel worden al is alles nog zo modern
Terwijl wij de les zoetjes aanhoren schrijft de onder
wijzer paieren vol voor de volgende les Naast de leraar staai
een robot die de lesmachine stil laat staan zo gauw een van
de leerlingen de winger opsteekt Dan krijgt dat meisje een
ijgen ook dansles met een beat
in plaats van handwerken
Qm uur kr ijgen we drie kwartier
pauze om te slapen
Als je ziek benfc krijg je een radio
waar de les door wordt gegeven Maar
als de cnderwijzer ziek is blijven
we thuis dan is er niemand om de
papieren vol te schrijwen
Dike middag staat er een grote wagen
van TtPietn met kroketten pepsiTs bolors enz Tcor de school
We drukken een knopje in en er wordt ons gebracht wat we wen
sen Betalen komt later wel
Iedere klas heeft haar beatband Tolley en softballteait
Ik werd ziek en ik wilde Tocr de eerste maal de les Tia
de radio horen Ik strekte mijn arm uit om de radio aan te

mijn arm uit maar niks hoor die werd weer teruggetrokken
steeds harder harder auJJ

een zalige droom En nu Tlug roetsj naar MSCHLnClara

Wat hij verwacht van de uitslag klopt niet precies zoals
u hU natuurlijk allemaal weet Maar er zijn er maar weinigen

die hoofd van een school kunnen worden Denkt u dat niet
Wei ga eens rond en kijk cf je er een vindtJ j
Waarcm moet dit gebeuren op een gebied waar men

ders maar als zij eens goed nadenken zullen zij zelf con

Want cm eIke vreemdeling hier weg te sturen is pure dwaas
heid Maar uvel degenen die jarenlang een functie tekleden j
die door een capabele Arubaan overgenomen kan worden
Maar jammer genoeg zijn het de Arubanen zelf die jaar

Het was voor de redaktie een pleiner u elke maand Bao dj Kwihi
te mogen leve re n Alles verliep vlot dank zij de hulp van
vele trouwe lezers die ons hielpen met artikelen
Natuurlijk gaat onze dank naar hen uit en ook naar de lerares
sen en leraars die ons blad met hun medewerking verrijkten
De redaktie leden hebben ijverig gewerkt cm het blad elke maand
op tijd te doen verschijnen Wij danken ook hen die ons daar
bij hebben geholpen vooral de stenoilaars fr Eugenius en fr
Bernardinus
Natuurlijk kunnen wij onze censor niet vergeten die nooit mop
perend maar altijd met een glimlach het ene vel na het andere
voltikte
Beste Lezers nogmaals hartelijk dank voor jullie medewerking
En ik hoop dat het volgend jaar de Bao di Kwihi nog een paar
bladzijden dikker zal worden Een prettige vakantie namens de
redaktie
Hoofdredakteur Erankie

Het einde van ons schooljaar is in zicht
Voor vele meisjes en jongens is het een bijzonder jaar ge
weest Ze hebben hun studie op de MULO bekroond wensen jul
lie allen van harte het allerbeste voor de toekomst Want nu
gaan jullie verschillende richtingen uit en zul je meer op je
zelf aangewezen zijn Laat zien dat je ruggegraat hebt zet
door houd vol en vorslap niet
Want zonder inspanning komt niemand verder Ook niet als
je vele talenten bezit
Jullie bent de mensen die de toekomst van Aruba bepalen
Jullie bent ook de jonge Kerk Er wordt iets van jullie ver
wacht Stel je omgeving niet teleur Durf goed te zijnJ
Voor alle andere leerlingen wenken de proefwerken Laten
we hopen dat een jaar van goed opletten en flink studeren eraan
is vooraf gegaan Dan is de kans op succes groot
Beste jongens en me isjes geniet daarna van een welver
diende vakantie Probeer hem verstandig te gebruiken dan zul
je ook volop ge nieten
Op september zien we de meisjes weer terug in het Maria
College en sommige jongens weer ervoor
Zr HelneNog gauw even een afscheidswoordje aan alle trouwe Bao di
Kwihiers en fover de muur hangers
Na zes prettige jaren op Aruba gaan we weer naar het land
van de kikkers We hebben hier echt fijne jaren gehad en ik zou
een heleboel dingen kunnen opnoemen waarvoor we graag hier
zouden willen blijven Wie weet komen we ober een aantal jaren
terug maar voorlopig moet ik eerst weer aan de studie Je ziet
wel je bent nooit klaar
Als ik aan het schoolleven van de afgelopen jaren terug
denk dan is er vooral n ding wat me op het Maria College bij
zonder heeft getroffen Dat is de zeer goede sfeer die er ie
der jaar weer in de e klassen heerste Ik kan jullie verze
keren dat heel wat meisjes hun mulcdiploma voor een groot deel
hieraan te danken hebben dat ze zich verantwoordelijk voelden
voor eikaars succes
Natuurlijk is het examen dat voor de deur staat altijd eer
sterke stimulans cm flink aan te pakken maar we hebben toch
duidelijk gemerkt dat een saamhorigheidsgevoel groeide dat meer
was dan een gezamenlijke angst voor het examen Hst zou ideaal
zijn dat dezelfde geest ook reeds in de lagere klassen aanwezig
was Mocht dit lukken dan is er een goede basis gelegd voor
een vruchtbare studie en dit wens ik jullie voor de toekomst
van harte toe
De allerbeste wensen en tot ziens

Ja de werke sljeid op de Antillen Langzaam maar zeker
is klit voor ons een algemeen probleem geworden ben feit waar
over men het hoofd breekt en waarvanmen de Juiste oplossing
nog steeds niet kent Jonge kerels die zonder werk zitten en
die tengevolge hiervan ten onder gaan Die volop tijd hebben
om alle kwaad ter wereld uit te halen
Ook het morele peil komt hierdoor onder niveau te liggen
Want doordat deze kerels geen werk hebben zitten ze de hele
dag door achter meisjesrokken aan De statistieken wijzen dan
ook dat het aantal ongehuwde moeders zeer groot is
Vaders van gezinnen die werkeloos zijn en die maar moe
ten aanzien hoe de vrouw alles op de een of andere manier
klaar krijgt Hoe hun kinderen zonder onderwijs moeten blij
ven want er zijn schoenen noch klren m naar school te gaan
Er is niet eens voldoende eten
Jonge meisjes met een mulo of mm sdiploma op zak
die alsmaar solliciteren en wachten Kan de regering hier
niets tegen doen Natuurl ijk heeft de regering wel geholpen
maar het probleem is hiermee niet helemaal verholpen
Uit het feit dat vele Antilliaanse jongens en meisjes
naar Nederland vertrekken om daar een of ander be oep uit te
oefenen blijkt dat de regering wel degelijk hulp geboden
heeft Zelfs krijgen de Antilliaanse jongeren de kans om elders
te gaan werkenOok de mannelijke werkkrachten hebben hulp gekregen Vlen
hebben de kans feehad on naar St Croix te gaan waar ze behoor
lijk kunnen verdienen En bovendien mochten de getrouwden hun
vrouw en kinderen meenemen Ook hieruit blijkt de hulp
Anderen die geen mogelijkheid hebben gehad cm weg te gaan
hebben hulp aangebeden gekregen cm al is het tijdelijk te
werken bij de hotels die nou in aanbouw sijn
Maar toch is de werkeloosheid op de Antillen nog groot
Op Curaac Bonaire en cp Aruba Iepen er neg steeds mensen rond
ie jong van geest zijn die de handen uit de mouwen kunnen
steken maar die geen kans krijgen cm dit te dcen Bet werk
ligt heus niet voor het prapen
Op Curaac en Aruba kemt dit mede doordat de cl iemaats hap
pijen vele mensen cntslagen hebben Een machine doet tegenwoor
dig het werk van mensen En deze tien mensen dan hce vin
den ze nou een middel van bestaan Het is treurig maar waar
Dit is het probleem van de werkeloosheid cp de Antillen
De oplossing is nog niet in zicht
ClgaGedurende de laatste weken heb ik als ik de krantenver
slagen over tpt conflict in het Midden Oosten zat te lezen
vaak teruggedacht aan bepaalde gebeurtenissen uit de tijd dat
ik door dat gebied reisde kis je zo aan het trekken bent
i valt er altijd wel wat te beleven
In de loopban de morger waren wein Beirut van boord ge
j gaan De zon brandde fe aan de hemel en wij rnren klaar om
avonturen te gaan beleven In een plezier ige stemming en vol
I enthousiasme stapten we in het voorhistorische vehikel dat
ons op de kade opwachtte We zouden lang in deze bus moeten
i ziften want pas laat in de namiddag zouden we Damascus de
hoofdstac van Syri bereiken Been nood wapt aan plezier sou
het ons niet ontbreken In het begin vorderden we langzaam
deweg liep omhoog maar toen we eenmaal Beirut achter ons had
den gelaten kwam onze chauffeur los Hij wilde ons zijn rij
kunst tonen De straat was ondertussen overgegaan in een hob
belige zandweg vol gaten en kuilen Hierover scheerde hij van
links naar rechts sneed bochten af en veroorzaakte bijna aan
rijdingen Zonder vaart te minderen dook de bus in de gaten en
kuilen en schoot er door de vaart weer uit Ieder moment ver
wachtten we een daverende klap waardoor het aftandse voervuig
en wij erbij in duizend stukken in het rond zouden vliegen
maar dat gebeurde gelukkig niet
Op de achterbank gezeten werden we om beurten tegen de
buswand en tegen elkaar geslingerd En naargelang de diepte
van de kuilen kwarten we zo nu en dan onzacht met onze schedel
tegen het dak van de bus o De overige passagiers hielden zich
krampachtig vast aan de stoelleuning voor zich cm niet onver
wachts zittend in het middenpad te belanden Ik dacht zeter
dat ik voortaan met een afgeplatte schedel door het leven zou
moeten gaan maar achteraf viel het nog mee Op een paar bul
ten na en enkele zeer pijnlijke plekken voelbaar als de kam
er overheen ging had ik geen zichtbare littekens ervan over
gehoudenAls we achter cm keten zagen we een sik etefgordijnOFSiJ
M ook al niet Teel te zien want de bus reed te todoren
Srld in de bus alsof hij thuis achter zijn krantje zat
Hit scheen deze dodenrit heel normaal te vinden
Wii vilden verschillende malen dat de chauffeur langzamer
i moest rijden maar door het oorverdovend rammelen hoorde ij ons
T rnl hpt eindelijk tot hem doordrong wat we wensten
Sfide hj fijn SrabSche tanden bloot maar vaart minderde
ihifniet We probeerden de gids te vermurwen maar zelfs op het
I ver zoek in z i j n eigen taal reageerde de chauffeur niet Uter i
Damascus heeft hij beweerd dat hij helemaal naet overdreven har
ef zeker niet gevaarlijk hacj gereden Maar die buitenlanders
waren niets gewend hij hadook nog gelijk want Ue chauffeur
die we later in het MiddenOosten meemaakten reden hard en in
onze ogen zeer onverantwoordelijk Toch hebben we nooit een a n
rijding gehad wat weer bewijst dat het buitengewoon goede be
stuurders zijn Zon slechte weg als naar Damascus hebben we
echterge toppen de nodige
douaneformaliteiten Dat nam nogal tijd in beslag en we beslo
ffS het grensrestaurantje iets te gaan gebruiken Dat was
wel nodig na zon angstige en vermoeiende rit We zagen er u
als nomaden onze kleren waren roodbruin van het stof r
ik de taf cr instapte keek ik heel toevallig naar de banden
van de bus Wat ik toen zag deed mijn haren te berge rijzen
Grote witte slijtplekken waren ztbaar Discus
Had ik ze maar met gezien De reis vanai ae
was Un nachtmerrie Ik zag slechte die versletenn fafstil
me en voelde de snelheid waarmee we vooruithotsten Ik was s
Zn spanning en angst De mens lijdt echter het meest onder het
Dajaaseuf teef te zicht en dterdat het verkter toenam moest
de chauffeur wel vaart minderen De zandweg werd weer een fat

examens
Fr Adrianus is in deze tijd hoofd van de school
Hij weet goed waar fr Arnold de schriften bewaart
In d heeft hij die niet zo veel nodig
juni Er stond een Culturele Voorstelling op het programma
Het orkest zou helemaal uit Amerika kanen laar hun
charterplane was niet van de KLM en ireeg dus geen

Vele leerlingen hadden niet naar de radio geluisterd
en kwamen voor niks op school Ze gingen met plezier
weer naar huis

De examens zijn voorbij Onze vier Bers slaagden nu
Voor muloA kregen jongens hun pntenlijstje De

Veel geluk en sterkte
CHioToen ik in de lagere klassen zat verlangde ik naar de dag
waarop ik van school zou zijn En nu ik zo ver ben gekomen
vind ik het erg jammer Nu pas besef ik hoe fijn de school ei
genlijk was
Ik wil nog graag in ons laatste nuttin er een woordje van
dank zeggen aan zuster Helne zuster Aletta leraren en lera
ressen van wie ik les heb gehad En zeer speciaal aan zuster
Doroth die me aangewe zen heeft als tedaktielid
Ik heb het erg fijn gevonden cm bij de redaktie te behoren
Het is een leuk jaar geweest dank zij het flink optreden van
onze censor en niet te vergeten kapitein Erankie
In het begin was het moeilijk met de jongens op te schie
ten die met hun grapjes voor de dagkwamen die de npoesn soms
niet kon verdragen Ik zal proberen om in de komende jaren
zolang onsfr schoolblad nog bestaat wat te schrijven en
als het nodig is opbouwende kritiek Ik hoop dat ikhet zilve
ren feest nog eens ooit mag meemaken want tegen die tijd looj
ik nog niet met een stokje rond geloof ik
Op het examen ben ik ook bij verschillende frres en lera
ren van het La Salie College aan het utafeltjeTt te re ent gekomen
Hen wil ik ook nog graag bedanken
Ik wens de redaktie van al veel sterkte en suc
ces toe En aan meneer Huisken die binnenkort ons eiland gaat
verlaten veel plezier en succes in Nederland U moet maar gauw
terugkomen want ons Maria College wil u beslist niet missen

De spanning buiten steeg hoorbaar Alle kandidaten wacht
ten zenuwachtig op hun vonnis dat niet lang meer op zich zou
laten wachten Sommigen zrten heel bleekjes aan een tafel an
deren ijsbeerden rond
MHa ha ha stoorde een zware stem de stilte Iedereen
draaide zich om o aar de jongen die hardop stond te lachen
en te praten Ook hij was een van de slachtoffers van vandaag
Maar er was geen spoor van ongerustheid in hem te bekennen Hij
had het hoogste woerd noemen ze dat een examen Het lijkt
wel of ze een eersteklashummeltje op de proef willen stejlen
Aardrijkskunde Praat me daar niet over Een is het minste
dat ik daarvoor kan krijgen Geschiedenis en Natuurkunde
laat me niet lachen Ik gaf antwoorden die de examinatoren met
hun mond vol tanden lieten zitten
En zo blufte de lange jongen door Zijn stem werd door
iedereen gehoerd zelfd de examinatoren binnen keken verbaasd
cm De jongen stond op een stoel en gaf aanwijzigingen Hij
alleen praatte Niemand stoorde hem Hij nodigde zelfs zijn
vrienden uit om die avond bij hem te komen feesten
Ha ha ha begon hij weer te lachen Maar plotseling
hield hij op en werd heel bleek Iedereen keek verschrikt cm
en zag nde meneer in de deur staan die de jongen met door
dringende ogen aankeek De jongen als gehypnotiseerd stapte
van de stoel af en ging erop zitten
Stmlte sneed de stem van de meneer de bromstemmen Het
werd akelig stil nWIllen de kandidaten binnen komen ver
volgde hij en stapte toen weer naar tinnen Alle kandidatenvolgden hem Als laatste trad de jongen binnen
De buitenstaanders gluurden door de glazeif n sagen tot
hun grote verbazing de jongen met een rood hoofd de zaal
langs een achterdeurtje verlaten Hij Was gezakt D enige van
die dag
Sbt duurde niet lang meer of de gelukkigen stroomden naar
buiten blij zwaaiend met hun puntenlijsten De bluffer sloop
stilletjes weg

SEPTEMBER WMMER
Beste Abonnees
We beginnen weer Aan de vijfde Jaargangl En met het
voile vertrouwen dat u allemaal minstend even veel belang
stelling hebt als vorig jaar Niet alleen dat u allee weer
van voor naar achter zult lezen maar cok lezenswaardige op
stellen kritiek en aanmoe dig ingen suit insturen
In cns eerste nummer komen nog niet veel leerlingen
aan het woord De schrik om te beginnen moet nog cverwonnen
worden Maar wij rekenen op vele bijdragen voor de komende
afleveringen Zet uw licht niet onder de korenmaat
Het nieuwe school jaar is al bijna een maand oud
Iedereen is goed begonnens een goed begin is het halve werk
Nu nog even volhcuden het jaar is zo om De redaktie wenst
leraren en leerlingen een mooi school jaar
redaktie
De jeugd van tegenwoordig is geen knip voor zijn
neus vmardc Dan wren wij in onze tijd stukken beter
Kom nou geloof je werkelijk wat je zegt
Ik was laatst in Madiki Plotseling stond mijn auto stil
Geen gasoline meer Twee opgeschoten knapen met min of meer
proyogezichten kwamen de stand van zaken opnemen Toen ze in
de gaten kregen wat het mnnkement was boden ze onmiddellijk
aan te helpen De een zooht iets wat op een blik leek en
sprong op zijn fiets Na tien minuten ms hij terug De ander
fabriceerde van een stuk karton een trechter zodater bij
het gieten in de tank geen druppel verloren ging Na een
kwartier was ik weer het heertje en kon mijn weg vervolgen
Ik weet niet welk vocabulaire de ze knapen over het alge
meen gebruiken En misschien kenhen ze de tien geboden niet
uit hun hoofd Maar christen zijn zeJ
Wele veil hier op een r teiland Iedereen denkt
enkel aan ziohzelf Zedoen enkel maar wat voor je als je
betaalt
Wei eens van generaliseren gehoord
Ik moest onlangs ongeveer vijfentwintig personen opbel
len cm een bericht door te geven Door omstandigheden had ik
daarvoor niet veel tijd Iemand die op mijn kantoor was en
dit bemerkte bood spontaan aan dit zaakje even voor mij opfee knappen Zo gezegd zo gedaan Zij nam het lijstje met de
namen en nurnmers mee naar huis Dezelgde avond nog was alles
gef ikst En ik mocht zelfs niet betalen voor het gebruik van j
de telefoon
Zou deze dame elke zondag naar de kerk gaan Missohien
welo Maar het is ook mogelijk dat ze het zo nu en dan vergeetj
In ieder geval weet ze wat onbaatzuchtige hulp is ji j
De winkeImeis jes van Aruba deugen niet Waardeloos
Ze jagen de klanten de winke uit
Zon vaart zal het waarachtig niet lcpen
Twee weken geleden zocht ik een bepaalde disco Bet ver
koopstertje kon die niet zo gauw in de winkel vinden Maar ze
ze I zich te herinneren in het nagazijn de bedoelde plaat ge
zien te hebben Bijna twintig minuten moest ze in een snik
heet pakhuis zoeken voordat ze het gevraagde gevonden had j
Haar moeite werd beloond en mijn wens ging in vervulling
j
Ik ken dit winke Ime is je niet Ik weet niet of ze katho j
liek proestant jodin of he id in is Maar waarvan ik overtuigd
ben is dit winkelmeisje weet wat pure naastenliefde is Ze
weet het niet alleen maar handilt er ook naar j
Daze belevenissen zijn heus niet uniek Jullie maken ze
ook mee Heb er oog voor Ontdek het goede in een ander Dan
leef je blijer en ook eerlijker
past N ErkampHet nieuwe schooljaar is alweer enkele weken oud
Je weet hoe het gaat als er een baby in de familie is ieder
een is nieuwsgierig hoe het kind het maakt Maar in het
geval van het nieuwe school jaar hangt het ock van ons ieder
persoonlijk af of dit jaar een good jaar zal worden Elk
afzonderlijk moot je er lets van zien te maken Het gaat
niet vanzelf goed
Natuurlijk denk je er niet elke dag aan dat het toch
eigenlijk wel iets bijzonders is dat juist JIJ mag stdderen
Ja dat meen ik werkelijk zos dat jij MAG studeren Hceveel
volwassen mensen zuchten niet Had ik vroeger de kans maar
Gens gekregen dan  T Vul dat nu zelf maar eens in dan
Hoeveel andere jongens en meisjes leven onder heel wat
moeilijker omstandigheden dan jullie hier op Aruba Zij moe
ten al mee zorgen voor het gezin zij staan soms alleen zij
mogen niet jong zijn
Daarcm heb je maar een plicht gebruik je tijd goed
Let op in de lessen en studeer elke keer voor de volgende
dag Niemand is in staat cm even een mooi cijfer voor een
proefwerk te halen En als je dit een enkele keer zou luk
ken dan gaat dat echt niet met het examen Kom zet je
schouders ercnder Verknoei je tijd niet Zie iets te berei
ken dan laat je zien dat er pit in je zit en bewijs je
Aruba ook een dienst
Ik wens dan ook ieder die serieus aan de slag is gegaan
heel veel succes Dit geldt wel bijzonder voor de tiende
klassen Tegen deze meisjes en jongens zeg ik Tot ziens op
het examen Dat staat weer zo voor de deur
En voor de anderen de tijd gaat snel
weZrBalena
Ik had nog niets gehoard van of over Bao di Kwihi
Zou het misschien bij een vierde levensjaar blijven Dat kan
ik moeilijk geloven cin meerdere redenen Ivlaar in elk geval
hing er voor mij nog een opvallende stilte ronds geen namen
van redakteurs en redaktrices werden er genoemd tot gisteren
vrijdag September Frank Kuiperi Rey di ja Roy van
wat zoals hij zichzelf graag noemt op me afkwam juist
toen ik de schooldeuren opgelucht wilde dichtdoen met het ver
zoek een artikeltje te schrijven en zoals je ziet deze keer
moest ik zijn zin doon
En nu zit ik hier op zaterdag daarna om uur als de
warmte weggetrokken is in mijn kamer te zoeken Net als een
jongen die voor maandag een opsjrel moet afhebben De inhoud en
de titel mag hij zelf kiezen Wat een vrijheidl
e eerste drie schoolweken zitten erop Heel mt lijsten
en lijstjes zijn gemaakt En die kijk je dan eens door Daar
heb je bv de vragenlijst voor elke leerling
Vraag s wanneer en waar hij geboren is geeft al merkwaardige
antwoorden Voor de een was dat Oranjestad voor een ander Ven
lo of New York of het Lagohospitaal of gewoon thuis Yooral
dat laatste is natuurlijk heel duidelijk en kun je zo naar On
derwijszaken opsturen
Vraag over de takken van sport en de
hobbys geeft een zeer rulme sortering voet
en softballen vclleyen tennissen hardlopen
fietsen jageh vissen schieten zwemmen
duiken schakeni dominoen kaarten
muziek platen kopen en beluisteren
naar de televisie kijken gitaarspelen H
pianospelen klassieke muziek stond erbijvender lezen tekenen vogels verzorgen een aquarium bij
hcuden konijnen en parkieten houden
dansen feesten van alles wat dat voor sport of
hobby is weet ik niet maar dat hoe ft ook niet als hijzelf
het maar weet wandelen jangens van de postzegels
verzamelen sigaren wat hi j be doe It is niet helemaal duide
lijkj gewoon oproken zal wel niet misschien de bandjes spa
re n en inplakken
ook nogs toneel spelen schilderen paardrijden vliegtuigen
kennen racen en elektrotechniek
fietsen reparenen en op een auto werken
stratego een uit d golf oen van de  zingen b
naar school gaan c die slaagt natuurlijk zeker dat kan
niet anders
Op de vraag hoe ze naar school gaan kwam natuurlijk met
eigen auto met de bus met de fiets en ook nogs te voet
Maar bij dit laatste heb je elk jaar in de e klas tenminste
nogal wat taalkundige varianten die op een examen echter tot
nu toe fcut gerekend worden zoals met de voeten op de voet
met voet de voet
De spelling wordt ook wel eens geradbraakt folly voor
volley beesbal of bestbal voor baseball kaper en baker voor
kapper en bakker pimpom voor pingpong
Nu wat over de school zelf Het valt weer op dat er in de
zevende klas sen zoveel kleine jcngens zitten en hoe spontaan
en vriendelijk velen zijn en met wat een fanatisme ze het
volleybalnet willen ophangen en zelfs het bord afvegen
Ook zijn er wel een paar heel grote bij en toch nog maar
Het zou wel eens interessant zijn te weten hoe hun eerste in
dr ukken zijn
Wat het leren en ook het gedrag betreft is mijn indruk dat
er toch zovelen zijn ook bij en bij bijna vanzelf
sprekend die echt met  gcede wil begcnnen zijn ze
willen echt maar een jaar over hun klas doen
Maar die goede wil moet na een tijdje door een gedrags
kaart kleine re en gro tre opzeggingen en proefwerken en
Kmogelijk zelfs een brief je of telefontje naar huis wat aan
gewakkerd wcrden want na de eerste drie weken zie je bij som
migen een inzinking de school wordt weer heel gewoon en waar
om zou je altijd zo je best doen
De lOe klas is altijd een enigszins apart bedrijf daar
wordt al gedacht dat moet tenminste want verleden jaar waren
jji de maand augustus dus twee maanden na hun examen een
paar die nog steeds niet wisten wat ze van plan waren in d
e klassen wordt dus al gedacht aan plannen aangaande studie
en beroepskeuze En dan denk je even aan al de geslaagden van
het afgelopen jaar van Alex Baptist tot en met Dennis Zeppen
feldt scmmigen zijn naar de UTS en zullen moeten laten zien
tot wat ze in staat zijn anderen naar de Kweekschoolafdeling
van Colegio Arubano dat worden dan onze collegaTs als ze
volhouden en wetenwat ze willen dan nog een viertal naar de
e klas HBS dat is geen peuleschilletje enkelen zijn met
een bears naar Nederland ca onze enige leerlinge Tica Giel
een paar zijn gaan werken ca Enrique Sanchez die nu in het
Strandhotel werkt maar meteen op een avcndcursus deorgaat
hij zegt niet veel maar hij doet het
Een paar zijn nog eens komen kijken of er hun cude school
nog staat of hadden lets te vragen of te zeggen Een kwam er
zo maar eens kijken het leek wel p heimwee
Nu nog een slot aan dit toch al te lange en ncg zeer on
volledige artike Itje
De school is niet alleen een leerinstituut een leeria
briek zoals aommigen dat noemen hoewel het leren maar dan
echt leren naar de mate van ieders mogelijkheden ook in de
verwachtingen van de uders en met het oog op de huidige maat
schappij toch wel heel belangrijk is maar moet de leerling
ook zien en helpen als jong mens die moet groeien in bescha
ving zelfkennis en zelfvertrouwen in toewijding uderliefde
dankbaarheid godsdienstzin evenwichtighe id van karakter
En ook dat gaat niet vanzelf en gaat niet volgens eenleerplan of een roosteriije maar wordt wel sterk bevorderd
door wat ouders grotere broers en zussen en de ie rare n doe n
en zijn veel meer dan door wat ze zeggen al kan menig ouder
persoon zich wel een raak gezegde of goed woordje uit zijn
jeugd herinneren dat hem bij is gebleven en dat hem goed
heeft gedaan
Jongelui veel succes in dit schooljaar het moge aange
naam en actief wezen

Reeds voorde grote vakantie werd mij medegedeeld dat ik
met September aan het Mpria College zou komente staan Dat
was natuurlijk fijn zo mar over te gaan Maar ik vcelde mee
met de kandidaatjes uit de e klas die eerst een zwaar en ge
wiohtig exainen moesten afleggen eer ze de trap op mochteno
Na de uitslag gingen we vakantie houden welverdiend
zegt men dan Je probeert dan de school en alle wat er bij
hoort te verge ten
Aahgezien ik een trip naar Montreal maakbe met een reis
gezelschap viel dat niet zo moe ilijk Sinds april van dit
jaar tot cktcber wordt in die stad de grote wereldtentoop
stalling gehouden de World Fair of Expo afkorting van Ex
position dus tentoonstelling i
Vele landen uit alle werelddelen hebben hier een paviljoem
gebouwd cm wat uniek is voor hun land te tcnen bv de tern
pels van Thailand of cm hun welvaart te laten zien bv Rus
land of hun kunst bv d Joropodansgroep uit Venezuela
Ook kun je hier al het nieuwe bv in de geneeskunde zien
zoals hartoperaties ed
De Expo wordt cm de jaar gehuden telkens in een un
der e stad In was het in New York Dit jaar in Montreal
was het erg interessant en educatief en over het sans uren
lang wachten in de rij cm een of ander belangrijk paviljoen
te kunnen bezihtigen werd niet erg geklaagd Zo hebben we
anderhalf uur gestaan voor het pavfeljoen van Canada voorkrui
pen was ten strengste verbcden waar een fantadtische dcoa
mentaire film ever Canada werd vertcond Maar we mcchten ook
met zijn tegelijk in de grete rende zaal cm staande deze
cineramafilm te bekijken Het was in een woord geweldig en
achteraf be zien vonden we het tech fijn dat we zo lang in de
rij zijn blijven staan
Even moest ik teen aan de school denken aan de meisjes
die dagelijks zwijgend minutenlang sons in de zen in de
rij moeten staan
Nu is het September en we zitten weer cp school Bijna
had ik de trap niet cp mogen gaan aangezien klas d waar
in enkele trouwgebleven leerlingen van het vorig jaar cp de
benedenverdieping gevestigd Is Dat is de klas met de cooler

Hij deed het mooi konden wij het zo maar cp het exa
men maar dat TtstaanM en dat sen uur lang
Hu daar sta je dan als nieuwe leerkracht op het Maria
College
Hoe voel je je die eerste lessen
OnwennigJ
Je spreekt de namen van de leerlingen verkeerd uit Wat
natuurlijk aanleiding gee ft tot daverende lachsalvoTs
In een klas bleek de plattegrond verkeerd te zijn zodat
het een verrass ing bleef wie zou antwoorden
Je weet niet in we lk lokaal je het volgend lesuur moet
zijn Stel je voor dat je in een verkeerde staat les te ge
veni
En vwat doe je als de hele klas je met Argusogen volgt
wanneer je een stapel boeken zoekt en niet kunt vinden
Wat doe je als je vier leerlingen uit een klas een spreek
beurt hebt laten voorbereiden voor de volgende week en op die
bewuste dag blijkt er maar een op school te zijn het had zo
geregendi
Dat zijn zo de ervaringen van de eerste weken
Maar deze belevenissen zijn niet het belangrijkste
Belangrijker vind ik dat je in die eerste weken ook hebt
ervaren dat er een leuke sfeer op school heersto En die is
eri Dat maakt het werken meteen prettiger
Daarom hoop ik nog vele jaren cp het Maria College les te
mogen geven
Kopijneen hersentoernooi tussen de verschil
lende muloscholen Alleen leerlingen van de lOe klassen mo
gen mee doen En we doen natuurlijk weer mee
Vorig jaar ierd het La Salle College kampioen Me

We doen natuurlijk weer mee Maria College heeft
haar eerste wedstrijd al verloren als jullie dit lezen Maar
het gaat in de vcorronden niet cm verliezen of winnen maar

lagere wijdingen ontvangt In maart zou hij dan sub
diaken worden in juni diaken en in december pries
ter worden gewijd
Het La Salle College heeft de laatste twee jaar zijn
studie betaald We zijn van plan dat dit jaar ook weer te doen
dn hopen ermee door te gaan tot en met zijn priesterwijding
Af en toe laat hij wel iets van zich horen maar cm
dat hij zo weinig antwoord krijgt corBespondeert hij niet
zo druki Zijn laatste brief is nu van juni vandit jaar
En de post gaat blijkbaatr erg langzaam want pas inaugustus
arriveerde zijn schrijven Toch willen we er graag iets uit
laten horen Hij schrijft in het Engels Geen moe ilijle taal
voor ons natuurlijk maar we vertalen toch maar

OKTOBER VIJFDE JAARGANG NUMMER
Beste Abermees
Ons vorige nummer werd nog voor een groot deel volgemaakt door
nietleerlingen Dit nummer is zeker beter in dat opzicht
Maar de redaktie meende toch een noodkreet te moeten slaken
en die vindt u op de volgende bladzijde
U stuurt toch ook een antwoord in op de vragen van blz
Dat wilden we graag bereiken dat er via ons blad een flinke
gedachtewisseling van de leerlingen losgeslagen werd Of het
lukken zal Waarom niet
We hebben twee nieuwsge zichten in de redaktie Tito en Glen
We verwachten heel wat van hen En Sonia Clara en Sandra
willen met een ttenerbladzijde beginnen Al in het volgend
nummer Wie helpen haar Al laat u bv alleen al eens weten
welke tienerster jullie het meest bewonderen
redaktieJa waar gaat dat naar toe En met dat bedoelen we
ons blad BAO Dl KWTHI Wij redaktieleden voelen ons ver
plicht jullie aandacht te vestigen op het volgende
Ons blad bestaat al vier jaar Dit is de vijfde jaar
gang En wij en jullie zeker ook zouden het jammer vinden
als het nou ophoudt te bestaan En zoals de zaken er hu voor
staan kon dat toch wel eens gebeuren
De redactie kamt sans bij elkaar met lege handen
Geen artikelen binnegekomen Wat nu Gaan smeken bedelen
cm artikels te krijgen Als de onderwijzers en onderwijzeres
sen niet regelmatig scljreven en er geen journaal in stond
dan kwam Bao di Kwihi nooit volt
Maar meisjes en jongens ons blad is geen onderwij
zersblad of journaalblad list is een leerlinge hbladEn
toch vr we van n van jullie leerlingen een artikel
krijgen moeten we eerst de hemel naar beneden halen Geen
tijd Wat moet ik schr ijven krijg je telkens als antwoord
Maar lieve mensen nog aan toe is het dan een redaktie
bladDan noemden we ons blad liever De Redakteurs cfl De
Reporters Wij zijn er niet om de BdK te vullen Wij
proberen met jullie bijdragen en de onze een mooi SCHOOL
blad te maken
Als we scans een en ander horen over ons blad dan
schamen we ons Bao di Kwihi Och een dood boek Alleen
maar opstellen Ja alleen maar doodgewone opstellen en
een puzzeltje als troost Wij zouden graag eens willen weten
wat jullie met ons blad doen Zo maar doorbladeren of lzenjullie wel het een en ander En als dat het geval is slikken
jullie dan alles wat erin wordt geschreven Bsbben jullie er
geen mening over Vinden jullie alle artikelen goed en waar
Wij denken toch van niet Want al we zo eens iets erover ho
ren is niet alles kck en ei
Monden hebben jullie ja maar krijgen jullie ooit iets
p papier Nee nooitJJ Wij redaktieleden vullen het blad wel
he Zouden julliewel willen Neem eens een voorbeeld In dit
nummer staan twee artikeltjes over Gemengde scholen en tij
een van die artikels staan een stel vragen Wij zijn erg be
nieuwd hoevelen nou een antwoord of mening insturen
Dat hoeft dan geen antwoord van twee kantjes te zijn met
een kort en krachtog telegram zijn we ook tevredenJ Als jullie
misschien niet durven omdat morgen je iedereen op school na
wijst stuur het dan onder een schuilnaam Klaar is Kees En
het zal geheim blijven Hst hoeft ook helemaal niet van jou
alleen te zijn Samen iets schrijven is ook leuk
dsb je een leuke tekening Stuur die in en we publiceren
Wees toch niet zo flauw meisjes en jongens en laat zien dat
jullie belangstelling hebben voer JULLIE blad Stuur wat een
tekening kritiek een mop een epistel Als je het over een
cf ander niet eens bent op school stuur maar De leraars we
ten niet wie het schrijft Maar daarbij kunnen we uiteraard
niet alles aannemen wij blijven verantwoordelijk En als je
anoniem wilt blijven moet de redaktie of iemand van de redak
tie toch wten wie je bent
Daarom lezers en lezeressen laat zien dat er wat spookt
m je hersens en schrijf Ons Ken je de redaktieleden niet
geef je produkt aan het hoofd van de school dan komt het wel
terecht in nieuwgierige afwachting

Op zaterdag oktober konden we de officile jeugd
zitting van de Verenigde Naties meemaken Afgevaardigden van
India en Nederland waren resp het Maria College en het La
Salie College
De zitting begon als gebruikelijk met een grappig
incident Bij het binnentreden van de Russische afgevaar
digden stonden die van Cuba op en applaudisseerden waarna
tussen beide groepen een innige begroeting volgde met vele
omhelzingen en schouderklopjes
ffet eerste punt dat ter discussie werd voorgelegd was
het Braziliaanse voorstel cm een permanente strijdmacht te
vormen die zou kunnen optreden bij agressie tegen een der
ledenlanden Omdat India de motie steunde kon daarna het
voor en tegen afgewogen werden Enkele afgevaardigden deden
dat met veel vuur zoals bv Amerika en Japan De afgevaar
digde van het laatste land had een prachtige speech waarin
hij aan drong op vrede tussen alle volkeren Juist Japan dat
geschonden iwerd door een atoombom in de laatste wereldoor
log weet hoe waardevol de vrede is
Het is jammer dat geen enkel land behalve India ge
bruik maakte van de mogelijkheid cm aan het eind van de be
spreking nog iets naar voren te brengen Dat maakte de dis
cussie tijdens de eerste zitting vlak en eentonig uitgezon
derd de overdreven echtRussische interruptie van Rusland
bij het stemmen en de kostelijke inleiding cp de speech van
Cuba waarin dit land een minuut stilte aanvroeg cm Che Gue
varra te herdenken Wat snedig ierd afgewezen door de voor
zitter oa omdat Che Guevarra een Argentijn wasDe tweede zitting behandelde een voorstel van India
om burgers van een lidland vrije vestiging te verlenen in een
ander lidland ten einde te komen tot sociale vooruitgang en
betere levensstandaarden
Nadat Brazili de motie gesteund had begonnen de dis
cussies die in het algemeen hierop neerkwamen dat geen der
landen zijn levensstandaard wilde verlagen omdat het anders
geen steun meer kon verlenen oa aan India Vooral de USA
bracht dit heel s cherp naar voren
China had een prachtige speech waarin de voordelen van
de motie van India puntgewljs zeven naar voren werd gebracht
De discussies werden levendig omdat nu ruim gebruik werd gem
maakt van de mogelijkheid om neg iets naar voren te brengen
Uiteindelijk werd de motie toch af gestemd zelfs door
Brazili die de motie had gesteund
Wat blijft je bij van zcfn avond
Allereerst de kreet van India en Japan in de eerste zitting cm
vrede en begrip tussen de landen onderling
Daarna de roep van India cm toch te komen tot een eenheid
tussen alle volkeren in de tweede zitting Een utopie
Toch is dit het einddoel van ons allen en ook van de Verenigde
Naties Daarom ben ik blij met deze jeugdzittinggn Ze drukken
je met je neus op wereldproblemen
Na de zittingen werd bekend gemaakt dat Erankrijk de
eerste prijd een beker gewonnen had Cuba en Japan kregen

oktober b dacht de volgende gelukkige te zijn Een van
onze Engelse leraren bleef thuis En hij was hun

We dachten dat we konden merken dat de Otters
het er niet helemaal mee eens warenoktober i Onze hersengymnast ie kers hebben het onderspt
moeten delven Tegen de Pieter Boerschool
Wat hebben we ons gergerd aan de radio Verlie
zen was niet eens zo erg maar het aantal punten
dat jullie gahaald hebben dat viel ons zo tegen
De cryptogrammen hadden jullie goed maar de ge
wone rekensommetjes niet En leer het woord
pyjama schrijven ook al spelde de spelleider het
zelf daarna ook verkeerd
Jongens het gaat om de naam van onze school en
om de wisselbeker niet te vergeten van het vorig
jaar Trek je niet teveel aan van deze kritiek en
van alles wat je al te horen hebt gekregen maar
zoeg ervoor dat je de score in de tweede ronde
gaat verdubbelen
oktober De klassers togen al vroeg naar een culturele
voorstelling We hebben ze niet hoeven te benij

CoCAo in plaats van prinsheerlijk in de bus ge
propt te zitten En het was al warm
Ze rekenden op ffet dagboek van een gek en wis
ten wat hen te wachten stond Het was allemaal
voorbereid in de klas
Maar de bovenramen waren niet verduisterd en
nu doodde de heer van Ulzen de tijd met een paar

gens wil stellenWaarom maken ze het La Salie en het Maria
college niet tot een schoolTf
Op deze vraag aan enkele meisjes kreeg ik geen ant
woord Ze wisten niet waarom en enkelen hadden er zelfs niet
eens aan gedacht Volgens mij zou het geen kwaad kunnen Ik
geloof dat we dan wat minder ffmuurhangersTf zullen hebben
Bovendien zal de verhouding tussen de jongens en
de meisjes heel wat veranderen En hun houding ook De meisjes
zullen dan minder aanstellerig en verlegen zijn De jongens
gaan de meisjes beter begrijpen en ze zullen hen niet meer
gaan beschouwen als minderwaardigen ofschoon dit in onze tijd
niet veel meer voorkomt Ifet zou wel goed zijn voor beide sexen
Natuurlijk zijn er ook nadelen Stel je voor dat
opeens alle jongens naar het Maria College kwamen Er zit dan
op het La Salie College zo goed als niemand meer in de banken
en de leraren kunnen tegen die banken praten Er zullen er dar
ook velen naar huis moeten want er is dan gewoonweg geen
plaats op het Maria College Die school zal dan moeten worden
uitgebreid meer banten meer boeken meer lokalen enz Dat
kost een hoop geld tiaar je weet nooit hoe een koe een haas
vangt
Misschienlater dan zullen die twee scholen toch
een worden Ze zijn nual in vele dingen n kijk maar naar
dit blad vroeger van n school nu voor beide Onze kinderert
zullen dan kunnen zeggen Ik zit op het Maria La Salie College
Dat zou erg leuk zijn

Beste meisjes en jongens

gende
Wij willen jullie aandacht vragen voor het vc
Al jaren hebben we gehoord over een gemengde school namelijk
ht Maria College samen met het La Salie College
Vinden jullie niet dat het idioot staat wanneer je Ts middags
voorbij het Maria College komt De meisjes lijken als gevange
nen en eromheen de TtboysTT met uitpuilende ogen
wee als je eens met een vriend durft te spreken Dan zijn
de ogen van de leerkrachten streng op je gericht Waarcm toch
Meisjes en jongens heus we willen dat jullie ernstig hierover
zullen nadenken Gaarne willen we ook de meningen van onze
zuster en frre horen
Waarom toch geen gemengde school
wat zouden de bezwaren zijn tegen een gemengde school
wat zouden de voordelen zijn
wie hebben de bezwaren
wat zijn de voorde leb Tan een aparte school voor jongens
en een aparte school voor meisjes
wat denken de ouders erover
a Maria CollegeHet schooljaar was ten einde Mijn zus ging weer met
verlof Dit was de tweede keer dat zij ging De eerste keer
was ik negen en dacht alleen maar aan haar terugkomst en wat
zij voor mij mee zou brengen Natuurlijk dacht je daar het
meest aan al kon je zoiets ook hier krijgen maar het was
nou eenmaal uit het buitenland
Maar deze keer is het niet zo want ze is van plan
ginds wat langer te blijven cm meer te weten te komen wat
zich in de Spaanse taal schuil houdt
In de vakantie heb ik haar erg gemist want ze is al
begin augustus weggegaan Dus was zij er de hele vakantie niet
om ons oeveral naar toe te brengen waar we maar heen wilden
We zijn wel overal geweest waar we naat toe wilden maar het
vervelende was dat je telkens vader moest vragen of je de
auto kn gebruiken soms kon het niet want hij had hem bv
een half uur later nodig voor de zaak dan moest hij zijn
eigen werk laten staan on ons weg te brengen soms kon hij
ons niet komen halen en dan kwamen we liftend terug
Dat hoefden we vroeger niet toen mijn zus een eigen
auto had want zij leende ons altijd haar kar als zijzelf
geen tijd of zin had cm mee te gaan Ze heeft de wagen helaas
verkocht voor zij vertrok en nou moeten we ht met een auto
doenOok als ik huiswerk maak mis ik haar want als ik iets
niet wist kon ik altijd bij haar terecht Op school voral
mis ik haar lessen want ik had liever handel van haar dan
van iemand anders Ik begreep haar dan ook altijd
c
i
I
Maar het meest mis ik haar p zondagen want dat waren
de dagen dat we samen veel plezier hadden bij het koken
Mislukte er scms iets dan bleven we de hele dag lachen en
moeder moest dan ook lachen of ze wilde of niet Ze begreep
eigenlijk niet hoe we zoveel lol konden hebben over iets dat
verloren was Maar bij cns was het nooit verloren want we
aten het ook zo op al smaakte het dan niet honderd procent

Ja op woensdag cktober verloor La Salie College
Pieter Boerschool met Er waren gemakkelijke
maar ook moeilijke
En ding begrijp ik niet en dat zou ik nou willen
vragens zitten in muloB altijd slimme jongens Ja dat is de
vraag De jongens van muloB behoren goed te zijn in de wis
kundevakken dat begrijp ik wel Maar zijn ze ook oed in de
ta en We hebben jongens die niet in de B zitten maar toch
beter zijn voor de hersengymnastiek dan de Bers Waarom dan
altijd Bjongens Van de vijf waren er vier van muloBe
Waarom niet minstens twee van de Akandidaten
Het is de eerste keer dat onze jongens zo weinigpun
ten hebben behaald Dat is niet goed voor de Kampioenen van
Het La Salie College kan zijn titell niet houden als
het zc doorgaat Nu staan wij met punten terwijl John Wes
ley er al heeft Zij zijn de besten tot nu toe
Hu heeft het La Salie College nog een kans Maar het
is toch maar een kleine Maar toch Je weet nooit hce een koe
een haas vangt
Daarom maar Hert time better luck
MrAtomieDe dag van het vertrek was aangebroken Precies om kwart
voor acht stond Bert voor het huis van Jan Vlug liep hij de
voortuin door en wilde op de deur kloppen Maar eer hij hier
voor de kans kreeg werd de deur met een ruk opengetrokken en
botste Jan tegen hem op fTHa die Bert Ben je bok al klaar
Bert wreef zijn voorhoofd dat in onzachte aanraking met de
elleboog van Jan was gekomen Sorry kerel lachte Jan
Jaife ouders verschenen nu ook in de deuropening en begroet
ten Bert Zo wereldreiziger schertste Jans vader lk zou
maar stevig oplopen als ik jullie was hebben jullie nu wer
kelijk niets vergeten De jongens beweerden dat ze alles
hadden ha een laatste handdruk stapten ze het hekje door de
straat op Glimlachend wuifden de ouders de twee vrienden na
Ze zagen er wel sportief uit Een grote rugzak met draag
stel was op hun rug bevestigd Met stevige passen waren ze
weldra om de hoek verdwenen We zullen maar hopen dat hij
vanmorgen vroeg uit zijn bed gepord is zei Jan Dit bleek
werkelijk het geval te zijn Hans stond hen al op te wachten
Morgen mannen ik sta hier toch minstens al een uur te
wachten Met blikkn vol afgrijzen keken de jongens naar hun
vriend Jij en op tijd komen zijn twee dingen die niet
bij elkaar passh Hans grinnikte en bekende dat hij er nog
maar liet stond Al gekheid makend hadden ze er een stevige
pas in gezet Daar stonden de busseh al te wachten op de rei
zigers Spoedig stapten ze in
ffens zat naast een dikke dame die belangstellend vroeg
waarheende re is ging Toen Hans zei datze naar Fontein
gingen vertelde ze dat ze daar cck eens was geweest Weldra
was Hans in een druk gesprek gewikkeld met haar
Jan en Bert hadden wel in de gaten dat de buurcrouw

In Santa Cruz moesten ze cverstappen in een andere

verbaasd staan door zijn eetlust Toen hij maar steeds weer
in e rugzak graaide en telkens weer een stukje brood tevoor

zich met volle mond naar hen toe en knikte vriendelijk Daar

H ZIJN LEVEN
nJan zit niet te suffen zei ik
Plaats van handeling een eohte meisjesschool
Tijd midden winter
Er waren toen inderdaad meisjes en jongens op nze
Middelbare Meisjes School Heel weinigen maar want Nederlands
zuchtte onder de ellende van de hongerwinter Kort en goed
kwam dat hier op neer dat je heel voorzichtig was in je sprejf
ken De verraders konden vlak bij je zijn Je had het koud eh
iedereen leed honger
Daar de brandstof ontbrak hadden alle kinderen gedwongen va
kantie Een heel jaar lang Maar er waren er natuurlijk ook
die ondanks honger en kou door wilden zetten Zo kwamen er f
dagelijks jongens en meisjes bij ons aan het klooster met del tfjfc
vraag of rve geen les wilden geven Al heel gauw hadden we w
over de honderd leerlingen van alle mogelijke scholen Boven
genoemde Jan zat in de derde hbs en ik spande me in om heja
en drie anderen wiskundeles te geven
Waar is nu je hu is werkschrift weer
nDat heb ik denk ik thuis laten liggen
Zijn broer keek me eens aan en ik snapte het weer Die jongens
waren de zonen van een officier van het Nederlandse Leger
Echte goede vaderlanders Ze deden allerlei niet op te noe
men werkjes telden oa Ts nachts de Duitse legerautors die
in een bepaalde richting over een grote autoweg raasden Die
berichten gingen dan ever de radio naar Engeland Daar pasten
ze de berichten in elkaar en zo kwam men aardig op de hoogte
van het doen en laten van de vijand
Enige maanden verschenen ze trouw op school Totdat
op een goede morgen beter gezegd een kwade morgen er eenstuk cf tien soldaten rond hun huis liepen Wij zagen dat
en hadden er veel zorg ever Be jongens hadden een goede
schuilplaats In vertrouwen hadden ze de Zusters dat wel eens
verteld Dat was tussen de vloer en het plafond van de ver
dieping er onder Maar daar hadden ze nu weinig aan want ze
zaten als ratten in een vale Men bleef het hele huis bewa
ken en we wisten dat er jongens opgesloten zaten Wat za
ten we in spanning Na twee dagen kwamen ze bleek en ellen
dig tevoorschijn Op een kar werden ze weggereden Waar naar
toe Later hoorden we dat er een geprobeerd had te vluchten
Hij werd weer opgepakt en alle zijn gefusilleerd Toen ik
dit maanden later hoorde besefte ik een moment wat het ze
gen wil je leven geven voor een goede zaak
Zij hadden in jeugdig enthousiasme gewerkt en hun
leven gegeven voor hun Vaderland Zij hoopterrp een betere
Pik tijd Zij wilden iets daarvoor DOEN
ooo ooo
Jongens en meisjes we staan nu vlak voor Kerstmis
Laat het even tot je doordringen dat Jezus niet op aarde
kwam cm gevierd en geerd te worden Ook Hij kwam om Zijn
leven te geven Kerstmis s een feest van veel licht van
gezelligheid van hetgoedhebben Vergeet niet dat het
voor Christus het begin is van een zware opgave die Hij
zich uit liefde tot ons gesteld heeft
Ik wens jullie allen een Zalig Kerstfeest en een
M gced begin in het Nieuwe Jaar Moge het Kerstkind ons de
moed geven on ons in te zetten voor de taak die we allen te
vervullen hebben
Zr HelneDe kaars is een van de cudste
christelijke symbolen en zij ti
heeft een geerde rol gespeeld
eeuwenlang bij de viering van
het Kerstfeest
In de Middeleeuwen werd er gezegd
dat het Kerstkind door stad en
land dwaalde op zoek naar hen die
in Hem gellofden tijdens de kerst
nacht
In die nacht plaatsten christenen
kaarsen voor hun vensters cm Hem
door de nacht naar hun huizen te
leiden En het was de gewoonte een
vreemdeling warm te ontvangen als
hij door het flikkerend kaarslicht
aangetrokken was om aan te kloppen
Kerstbomen met kaarsen versieren werd
het eerst gedaan in Duitsland Nu dra

DE DUISTERNIS
Ja nu ik deze zin wil gaan uitwerken merk ik dat ik
nog in de sfeer van de hersengymhastiekwedstrijd leef
Dan worden er telkens wetenschappelijke pijlen op je
afgewurd waar je dan meteen een antwoord op moet we
ten zodat ik het licht der wetenschap steeds brandende
moest houden
Hu ik dan ook schrijf licht denk ik aan het licht en
de kandelaar het licht onder de korenmaat Van Dale
weet nog veel meer want er zijn grote en kleine
lichten
En weer verder schrijvende denk ik aan het eerste le
venslicht aanschouwen het licht dat de donkere kamer
de donkere straat verlicht wat een geluk dat we dat
hebben De zon niet te vergeten Aruba zou zonder zon
geen Aruba zijn Zonder levenslicht de zon en de lamp
zouden we gewoon niet kunnen leven
Er is ook een donkere kant er zijn mensen die elkaar
het licht in de ogen niet gunnen Dan zal hun leven wel
niet zo prettig zijn dus niet vol licht en blijdschap
Een ongelukkig naar leven Kort cm zonder licht en leven
gaat het niet
Ebt is daarom dat ook Christus van zichzelf zegt
Xk ben het Licht en het Leven En op de komst van dit
Levende Licht gaan we ons voorbereiden
Een schip op zee dat een lichtje ziet weet zijn koers
Een verlicht bord geeft me s avonds de goede richting
aan Is het duister in mijn hoofd dan ga ik mijn licht
bij een ander opsteken
Is het centraal proefwerk dan hoop ik dat me veel
lichtjes opgaan als ik de vragen moet beantwoorden
Ga ik mijn vriend of vriendin bezoeken dan weet ik
dat als ik licht zie er ook leven is ze dus thuis zijn
Dat maakt me blij
Omdat wij het bovenstaande o goed begrijpen gebruikt
Christus woorden die ons Zijn komst duidelijk moeten
maken Zijn Licht is eigenlijk te verblindend voor ons
en toch wilde God dat wij Hem zouden zien Zijn licht
moest zichtbaar worden Daarom werd Christus mens en
toen kwam dus het Licht in de wereld on een licht te
werpen op alles wat menselijk is Een nieuw licht op
ons lachen en huilen spreken en zwijgen op beminnen
en haten op vrede en oorlog op leven en dood
Hoe moeten we leven
Waarom dit lijden in mijn leven
faarcm steeds oorlog
Waarom zorgen voor arme medemensen
Moge Christus met Zijn Leven cns verlichten en ons zo
een antwoord geven op deze vragen
Moge alle lichtjes die we met Kerstmis op Aruba zullen
zien ons herinneren aan het Licht dat in de duisternis
op aarde kwam en moge het ons de weg wijzen naar God
die mens werd voor ons

Het loopt tegen Kerstmis Jos slentert al een uur
tje in de Nassaustraat Bijna bij elke etalage blijft hij
stilstaan om de mooie kerstcadeautjes te bekijken Hij zou
zo graag een nieuw autootje willen hebben Zijn moeder
is erg arm Zijn vader heeft hij nooit gekend
Opeens blijft Jos stokstijf staan bij het zien van
een glimmende rode wagen in de deuropening van een winkel
Met begerige ogen kijkt hij ernaar Ah wat is dat mooi
Hij gaat bij de tafel staat waarop de auto staat en ziet
dat door de drukte in de winkel niemand naar hem kijkt Tfriji
strekt zijn handjes uit naar het autootje en kan er net
bij Hij neemt het van het tafeltje en sluipt ermee weg
Ongelukkig genoeg ziet een verkoper het gebeuren en
holt de jongen achterna Hij haalt Jos in voordat hij
de hoek cm is en trekt hem aan zijn mouw Als Jos zich
cmdraait ziet de verkoper dat die jongen iets bekends
heeft Dit kind lijkt sprekend op zijn vrouw die hij
vroeger zo verwaarloosd heeft Altijd kwam hij dronken
thuis en gaf haar nooit geld om het gezinnetje te onder
houden Toen moest ze zelf gaan werken en hij zag in dat
hij helemaal niet meer nodig was en hij verliet haar en
haar huis Ergens op een kamertje was hij alleen gaan wo
nen Hij liet toen niets meer van zich horen maar kreeg
r naderhand steeds meer spijt van Maar teruggaan en
vergiffenis vragen heeft hij nooit gedurfd

zijn en hij vraagt Jos terwijl hij zijn mouw nog steeds
vasthoudts MKind waarom heb je deze auto meegenomen Je
wil hem zeker erg graag hebben h Kom laten we terug

Babia una vez una familia muy pobre se sostenia de lo
que la madre ganaba lavando y planchando ropa para la
gente y de las pequenas sumas que traian sus tres
hijotos que se las ganaban por las calles de la ciudad
corno limpiabotos
No era mucho lo que reunian entre todos pero si lo
suficiente para sobrevivir Ccmo se acercaban las Pas
cuas la madre se dedico a trabajar duro para asi
poder darle a sus tres cachorrcs eiquiera una vez en
la vida el recuerdo grato de una feliz navidad Como
vieja costuiabre de los latinoamericanos los ninos le
escriben una carta al Nino Jeuus pidiendole que les
traiga un regalo en el dia de Navidad
Una noche la madre los oy hablando sobre que le iban
a pedir al Ninc Jesus y cuando se durmieron ella entro
en el cuarto donde ellos dprmian y recogio ss pequenas
cartas Uno de ellos le pedia una bicicleta otro un
bulto nuevo en dcnde meter sus libros colegiales y el
otro le pedia un par de revolveres de esos que usa nEl

La madre al leer estad cartas se posu a llorar en
silencio porque no sabia como realizar el deseo de sus
tres queridos hijos Durante una semana estuvo trabajando

Cuando ya habia terminado con su labor la senora le
pregunto por que traba jaba y que si ella no tenia hij os
que la ayudasen entonces ella le conto el estado en

A la senora le dio pena y para ayudarla le dij o que el
dia de Nochebuena podia venir eon sus tres hij os a su
casa y que ella le daria mas dinero para que pudiera
comprar los regales para sus hijos
Al oir esto la madre se qjred boquiabierta y no supo
que contstarle para darle las gracias
Y asi sucedic el en la noche se encontraban todos
reunidos alrededor de un arbol de navidad cantando una

juntos fueron repartdos los regalos los ninos se
sentian Delices al ver que habian recibido el regalo
que le habian pedido al Nino Je sus

In een klein armoedig huisje aan de rand Tan de grote stad
zaten op een avond een man en een vrouw voor het telkens
kleiner wordens vuurtje Somber staarden zij voor zich uit
Beiden dachten aan het komend kerstfeest dat ze dit jaar
helaas niet zouden kunnen vieren
Ik ga even naar de kinderen kijken verbrak de jonge
vrouw de stilte Ze stond op Verdrietig knikte de man haar
toe en zij verliet de kamer Voorzichtig opende zij de deur
van de kleine slaapkamer waar haar drie kleintjes rustig
sliepen Eerst sloop zij naar het bedje van Frans de oudste
vijf jaar Hij sliep met een zalige glimlach Waar droomde
hij toch van En opeens was het of de vrouw de stem van
Fransje hoorde zoals hij vanmiddag tegen haar sprak
Zeg mammie de juffrouw heeft ons vanmiddag geleerd hoe
je een kribje moet maken Ook heeft zij ons de kerstboom
leren versieren Zeg mag ik u dit jaar helpen mams De
boom versieren Dan kopen we een grote bos van dat eng
eng Hoe heet dat ding ook weer
Engelenhaar rakker had zij toen geantwoord Nou dat
dan Weet u mams bij de winkel om de hoek heb ik mooie
kerstboomballen gezien Grote en kleine groene blauwe
en een heleboel kleuren meer Zullen we zoTn pakje gaan
kopen
Ja jochie als pappie thuiskomt zal ik er met hemeens
over praten Maar ik beloof je nog niks Wees nu zoet en
ga maar spelen
Hoe blij was hij toen weggehuppeld zich verheugend op de
mooie kerstboomballen En hu nu komt dat akelige dat Frans
was ontslagen en dat hij gen geld zou krijgen voor deze
maand Langzaam gleden de tranen over haar wangen en vielen
op het bedje van de slapende jongen
Wat is er toch Lena Huil je vroeg Frans
Q Frans wat is het leven toch ellendig en God onrechtvaar
dig snikte LenaTLena toch zei Frans zacht
Dat mag je niet zeggen Kan
vrouwtje laten we naar se zitkamer
gaan Hier kunnen we de jongens
wakker maken en zachtjes duwde
Frans haar voor zich uit A
Weer namen ze plaats op de stoelen
waarop ze daarnet zaten Verdrietig
ging Lena zitten en staarde in hei
gesmeulde vuur
Frans ijsbeerde wat rnd met een y
frons tussen zijn ugen Eindelijk
stond hij stil en keek toen Lena
aan en begon Lena kunnen we echt geen Kerstmis vieren dit
jaar Even bleef het stil en toen begon Lena hartstochtejk
te snikken Frans liep meteen naar zijn vrouwtje en omhelde A
haar Zacht zei hij teen Kan dat echt niet vrouwtje mijnft AV
Frans vergeef het me Wat ben ik toch hard tegen jou
geweest In plaats van je te helpen maak ik het nog moeilijk
ker Ja ook zonder geld kunnen we Kerstmis vieren Natuurlijk
We kunnen alles zelf maken en jij kunt met Fransje een den
in de buurt gaan kappen Ik kan oliebollen bakken en wat
zullen whet gezellig hebben
De volgende dag heerste er een flinke drukte
in en rond het armoedig huisje van Frans en
Lena Bob en Rina de twee kleinsten kleur
den de slingers die moeder had gemaakt
fieciertkte oliebollen Fransje en zijn
vader haalden een
mooie denneboom Jkt
I s Avonds zongen de
kinderen alle kerst
ij liederen die zij ken
den en werkten een
groot aantal olie
bollen naar binnen
Bet werd toch een
heel gezellige Kerst

Schod Is de zuster misschien bang dat de meisges
zich niet meer goed zullen gedragen en niet meer zuli
f yy len leren Denken ze misschien dat ze met de jongens
vggaan flirten of lets dergelijks Nou wij willen lie
VvVer een gemeftgde school Want volgens de zuster houden
modeshow voor de jongens Nou dat is we een beetje
ioteveel het tcppunt We kunnen niet eens rondlopen
en als we met een vriend spreken dan kijken de leraars
pgen je stseng aan Bet is net een kostschool of beter
vVSezegd het is een kooi waarin we zitten rpgesloten en
iyWaar de jongens omheen staan
X
yls we tech een gemengde school krijgen zullen de jon
NSens misschien beter gaan studeren en de meisjes kunnen
ivGter zien hoe het is om met nette jongens te praten
n niet mer z idioot doen want er zijn veel meisjes
ie als ze een jongen zien idioot deen Ze doen alsof
nooit jengens hebben gezien
Waniaeer we die gemengde school hebben kunnen we honderd
Nijaar kampioen zijn van de hersengymnastie
ar als we die gemengde school krijgen kunnen we nu
met lanSe broeken op school kemen want de hele
jurkjes langs de jongens te lopen vinden we
Cxook te erg cf anders moesten we altijd met smalls komen
Maar met lange broeken op school komen vinden we hele
niet g hoor Ook als de school niet gemengd zou
deGillen we vragen of we met lange broeken op
vAchool kunnen komene We vinden dat gewoon want als we
VvrxvxlariDft broeken aan hebben hetben we toch kleren aan en
dus niet in Evas kleren rond
lets De andere scholen zijn begonnen met voor het
end geen huiswerk te geven Dat vinden we ook eeniO
v
vgoed idee of we dat cek mogen
Waarom mogen we geen carnavalsfeest vieren Dat vinden
we ook heel gewoon Alle scholen van Aruba doen mee aan
carnaval maar weer blijft het Maria College achter
We hebben hier op school zeer mode meisjes die mee
kunnen doen aan de koninginsverkiezingen en de jongens
van La Salle College kunnen het ook doen met de prins
verkiezingen En ze kunnen als naam krijgens Koningin
van het Iviaria College Prins van het La Salle College
Dan zullen we voor hen gaan schreeuwen cm te zien dat
we ook een koning in en prins kunnen krijgen
lVlaar we bedoelen als er een feest is dan mogen de me is
jes van de e ook kcmen En niet alleen die van en
Eigenlijk hoort de e er ook bij want zij zitten ook
op het Iviaria College maar die van de e zijn toch wel
te klein
En nu rekenen we cp veranderingen van de zusters en de
freres
leerlingen die graag
veranderingen willen
oooooooooooooooo

Wij vinden de vo or s tel ling van klas a LSC niet juist
Als ze de e en e klassen van het MC naar het LSC
willen sturen dan kunnen ze het laten zoals het is l
Wanneer ze gemengd bedrijf willen hebben vinden we
dai het beter is cm de le tot en met de e klassers MC
naar het LSC te sturen en de e tot en met de e

Als ze het zo doen hebben we de gro teren en A klei

GEMEIGDE SCHOOL v
Een drietal meisjes van de e klas van het Maria College
v wilde met het hoofd van La Salle College eens komen pra
ten over de mogelijkheid am van het Maria College en het
La Salle College een gemengde dat is twee gemengde scho
V len te maken of beter gezegd ze wilden eens weten wat
anderen oa het hoofd van die school ervan dachten
wA
y
Een interview hoefde het niet te worden hoewel de jonge
dames wel met papier en potlood gewapend waren Het werd
meer een gedachtewisseling Wat de voordelen waren of
er ook nadelen of althans moeil ijkhe den van organisato
rische en andere aard waren Wie er iets moeten doen als
vvj er iets gedaan moet worden
k Een dag of tien daarna kwamen ze nog eens terug ze had
jden intussen ook met het hoofd van het Maria College ge
sproken en ik heb ook jier en daar eens gepolst medeMr
pp
naar aanleiding van wat deze meisjes zeiden en voorstel
den En bij het tweede onderhoud heb ik beloofd het een
ander op papier te zetten voor Bao di Kwihi zeals
ze van begin af aan vermeld hadden
fTRDaar gaat ie dan
rfiviDat een gemengde school voordelen heeft dat is kan
lthebben is me ook uit gesprekken en lectuur duidelijk
De jongens zullen wat fijner van manieren en galanter
tpwerden Dat wil niet zeggen dat er op een uitsluitend
jongens school niet vele jongens zijn die toch al keurig
en galant zijn maar het is waar dat er bij enkelen in
tdit punt nogal wat hapert en er kan terecht verwacht
jvorden dat dit onder invloed van de meisjes beter zal
worden
A l
De jongens zullen mogelijk meer studieijver gaan ontplocien het is echter cok best mogelijk dat als het
nieuwe eraf is die ijver bij menige knaap weer zal
verslappen
Door de veelduldiger omgang van jcngens enmeisjes zal
dit iets heel gewoon wcrden bij sommigen zal de ver
legenheid verdwijnen bij anderen zal de belangstelling
voor meisjes alsof het wezens van een andere planeet
zijn wat gewoner worden In een woord hun opvoeding
kan in dit opzicht wat harmcnischer worden
Deze voordelen zullen natuurlijk niet automatisch tot
stand kornen als dat zo was zcuden alle gemengde scho
len van de hele were Id toonbeelden zijn van ijver en j
al wat maar good en edel is
Er zullen nog wel meer voordelen zijn die tot de reele
mogel ijkheden behoren i
Dat er geen jcngens meer dan bij het Maria College of I
ook bij het dan gemengde La Salle College zouden rcnd
hangen of lummeien is cok dan dubieus want er zijn I
nog wel andere grcepen jcngens die er die liefhebberij
cp na houden jongelui die ergens anders op s ohocl of j
niet meer op school zijn In dat opzicht kan men de mu
loschool van Santa Cruz niet met de situatie hier Ser
gei ijken Dit tussen haakjes
Dan nog iets tussen haakjes Als voor Nederland de ge
rnengde school het best wordt geacht is het dit ook
zonder meer nog niet voor elk ander land hoewel het
ook voor hier de meest gewenste situatie kan zijn cf
worden maar niet zonder meer omdat dit in Nederland
zo is
J
I r
Nu iets over de mce ilijkheden of de bijzondere cmstan
digheden
Dat het Maria en La Salle College vlak bij elkaar lig
gen is een grcte praktische moeilijkheid bij het cm
zetten van deze scholen in gemengde scholen hoe meet
de verdeling gebeuren Een geografisch houvast een re
del ijke grenslijn of rayonaanduiding is er niet De j
keuze nan de leerlingen dat is aan de ouders cverlaten
I
lijkt het enig redelijke of zullen die dit aan de
schoolie idingen of schoolbesturen overlaten wat een
niet redelijk en niet te verwachten afstand doen van
ouderlijke reohten is
Er is hier namelijk geen sprake van een geograiSisch
verantwoorde verdeling En bij die eigen keuze van on
ders en leerlingqn kunnen de vreemdste situaties ont
staan die de twee verschillende schoolbesturen aan de
enp kant voor een overschot aan personeel en lokalen
kunnen plaatsen aan de andere kant voor een tekort Dar
zou het een school moeten worden met een kleine
leerlingen
Zouden de scholen behoorlijk uit elkaar liggen dan was
dit punt dus hee ander s
Wasen de scholen kleiner dan was het ook eenvoudiger
j en doelmatiger
j Is elke onderwijzeres van het Maria College bereid aan
gemengde klassen les te geven
Voornaam is ook de vraag wie moet het initiatief tot
deze omzetting nemen
ilLlc de cuders Zouden zij in cergrote meerderheid deze
verandering wensen dan zouden zij met de schoolbesturen
overleg kunnen plegen aangaande de praktische mogelijk
heden
I i
Nu zeggen soinmige jongens en ook meisjes dat hun ouderjs
bet goed vinden zoals het nu is Hst Maria College is
sen goede school het La Salle College is een goede
schools Waarcm zcu men dat het andere dat dan in theo
fie en als mogelijkheid wel be ter lijkt maar oa prak
bisch op het ogenblik grote mceilijkheden biedt trach
fcen te verwezenlijken als men tevreden is met de hui
iige gang van zaksn
ij moeten trouwens niet cverdrijven het is heus niet
alsof de leerl ingen van deze scholen op een internaatV
leven waar ze de andere sexe nccit tegenkomen
Ifet is daaram gezien alle Taktcren die in deze kwestieSh
een rol spelen niet te verwachten dat deze schoien in
een zeer nabije toekomst gemengd zullen wordenZou er elders een aftakking komen dus een nieuwe mule
dan zou die allerwaarschijnlijkst wel gemengd worden
De opvatting dat dergelijke sdjjclen reele opvoedkundi
ge voordelen bezitten heeft daar geen last van tcven
genoemde emstandigheden
Ik begrijp dat deze persoonlijke mening en verwachting
vooral bij de leerlingen wel enige teleurstelling zal
veroorzaken Maar deze meisjes hebben inede namens ande
ren een eerlijke mening gevraagd en die heb ik gegeven

KRITIEK OP DE REDAKTIE
oooooooooooooooooooooo
In het voorwoord van de BdoK van het novembernummer vragen
jullie om een nieuw entwerp vocr de cmslag van het schoolblad
Jullie willen de cmslag vervangen misschien moderner maken
straks gebeurt hetzelfde met de artikelen cp den duur bestaat
Bao di Kwihi niet meer
Waar cm moeten jullie de cmslag veranderen De leerlingen zijn
al vertrouwd geraakt met het ontwerp van Hubert Oduber laat
het dat ontwerp blijven
Toen BdK voor het eerst verscheen zat ik in de e klas
van het LSC Toen heeft fr Arnold verteld dat het LSC
verscheidene schoolbladen heeft gehad bv TOTEKKI maar geen
hield het lang vel BdK verschijnt al een tijdje dus hou
het zc GEEN VERANDERINGEN
MITOIn een tijd dat er ontzettend veel kritiek is op
het doen en laten van de jeugd tussen en is het
erg prettig ook een woord van lof te laten horen
ifet is te begrijpen dat jongens en me is jes op de
ze leeftijd open staan voor alles wat nieuw is en dik
wijls in het navolgen van hun idcol de grootste ver
gissingen begaan
Oudere en wijzere mensen schudden hun fyoofd en
laten dikwijls niet veel heel van het optreden van de
ze groep
Laten we nu deze zelfde meisjes en jongens nu eens
bekijken als het ercm gaat ernstig te zijn Als er een
ziek klasgenootje is dat belangstelling en hartelijk
heid nodig heeft
Ze zijn zo spontaan dat er maar een klein duwtje
nodig is cm ze los te krijgen
Uit eigen ondervinding weet ik dat als er een be
rcep op hen gedaan wordt ze dadelijk komen aandragen
met kleine aardigheidjes en in een geval van langdurige
ziekte er ook mee doorgaan
Dit alleen al vind ik een gunetig voorteken Ifet
bewijst dat ze in geen geval egristisch zijn
Velen die wat leeftijd betreft nog graag een
tiener willen zijn kunnen aan deze vorm van naasten
liejMe een voorbeeld nemen

Mejuffrouw R Terwijn een zus van zuster Helene hebben we
gevragd iets in ons blad te schrijven nu zij voor een maand
op Aruba is Hier is zij aan het woords
BESTE MEISJES EN JONGEHS
Jullie vragem mij zo maar iets te schrijven in jullie lijf
blad Hier volgen dan enkele impressies
Met uur vertraging kwam ik vlak voor Kerstmis cp jullie
mode e iland aan Efet was wel wat heet want ik stapte van
de winterse kou zo in de tropische hitte En dan zijn dit
nog de koele maand en
Jullie mceten we ten dat je in Nederland nu lekker
bij de warme kachel zit Alle ramen zijn dicht en als je je
stofdoek uitslaat doe je het raam op een kiertje open en
zegts Brrr Dat gaat hier gemakkelijker he
Ga je boodschappen deen dan spring ge op je fiets
Je auto kun je haast niet parkeren dus is een fiets veel
handiger Maar dat wil zeggen dat je je eerst warm inpakt
Dan doe je een dikke jas aan daaronder zit een wollen shawl
Natuurlijk vergeet je ook je wollen hoofddoek niet of een
of ander mutsje wwe als het regent Dan gaan over al die
spullen nog een regenjas en een regenkapje Je bent dan twee
maal zo dik
Ja dat is hier even anders En dan het bed ffet is
iets dat me ook cpvalt In Holland doe je drie uur van te
voren een elektrische deken aan Als je dan s avonds in je
bed duikt voel je een behaaglijke warmte Twee of drie
wollen dekens helpen om je die nacht warm be houden Natuur
lijk zijn er van die kapitalisten die hun hele huis verwarmd
hebben maar ik doe liever het raam op een kiertje open Het
is fris en gezond
Een ding vind ik hier verschrikkelijk dat zijn de
muggenc De hale dag TknabbelenM die dieren aan je armen en

ik allemaal stond te vloeken ik sta nu mooi vocr schut
OP SCHOOL
Nadat de eerste dagen verstreken w aren en we vrien
den hadden gemaakt begonnen ze ons daar allerlei vragen over
Aruba be stellen Wonen er op Aruba kannibalen Wonen jullie
daar in hutjes en krctten en grotten Lopen ze daar in hun
nakie rend
Ze vertelden ens dat er vaak dccumentaires op de tv waren
over de West en dat je alsmaar negers en onderontwikkelde half
naakte mensen zag Ze vroeen cf we afstammel ingen waren van
die negers Van Curagao hebben ze wel gehoord en ze veronder
stelden dat Aruba een cf andere hcTfdstad van Curagao was
Bet beeld dat ze van ens hebben is dat van messentrekkers
dieven en zo Een geeie raad als jullie hier komen en ze vra
gen waar komen jullie vandaan zeg dan nooit van de ANTILLEN
maar zeg van ARUBA Onder Antillen verstaan ze Curagao
Oorzaak van het verkeerde beeld van Aruba Het komt door de
volgende reden Als bv een Curagaoenaar een meisje op de wal
let jes in Amsterdam neersteekt dan staat er to de Telegraaf
grootste sensatieblad van Nederland met grote vette letters
Antilliaan pleegt amok cp Zeedijk Daar onder klein gedrukt
Een jarige charmeur afkepstig uit Curasao heeft de pu
blieke vrouw XY na geldgeschil neergestoken
Een ander voorbeeld De Antillen komen hier baseball spelen en
winnen de eerste iedstrijd Wat staat er in de krant Nederlandse
henkbalselectie moest het hoofd buigen voor de Curagaosei Sam
Jacobs was pitcherc Volgende wedstrijd speelt Jacobs niet mee
en Curasao verliest In de krant staat Antilliaanse honkbal
van het veld geveegd door onze naticnale sterren
Ze moeten hier wel denken dat alles geregeerd wordt door Cura
sao Bij de devaluatieaffaire van de sterling werd doer de
tv angeroepen Curagao heeft besloten cm zijn munteenheid
niet te devalueren Ik dacht dat er een Antilliaanse Bank was
en dat Aruba daar zijn deel in had

hot was donderdag onze laataste schooldag voor de
kerstvakantie In vele klassen stonden de meisjes voor de
klas de burden te versieren Dit was voor de cuders die
die avond de rapporten zouden komen haleru Alle proefwerken
waren al lang achter de rug Ook de hersengymnastiek was nu
definitief afgelopen Onze school hud eerlijk de strijd ver
loren maar nietalles  ffet Sint Augustinus College had
ons beloofd dat als ze zouden winnen we een halbe taart van
hen cadeau zouden krijgen Deze belofte waren onze meisjes
al lang verge ten IViaar het gebeurdoJ
On precies uur ze hadden op dat uur afgesproken
hoorden de tiende klassen gestommel op de trappen Even later
verscheen er een frere op de gang Toen wisten we het weer
de halve taart Een heleboel meisjes hingen uit de ramen en
keken verlangend naar de grote doos of keken ze naar de per
sons n die de doos brachten ha een poosje gingen we naar de
klas van zuster Aletta Onder luid zingen ontvingen we de
jongens Ze gngen achter in de klas staan en overlegden wie
het TAEerd z u voeren Toen stapte er eentje naar voren en over
handigde de doos aan een van onze hersengymnastiekme isjesn
We juiohten enwensten hen geluk met hun succes Zuster Alettu
hie Id hen een tijdje aan de praat maar zond ze al gauw de
deur uit zodat ons feest kon beginnen
Er was eenter een groot probleem Hoe kon je een
have taart verdelen in drie klassen Hierop wist zuster raad
Een paar minuten het leken wel uren was er een hele taart
in de doos ontstaan Hoe dat kon Wel de zuster had de halve
taart in twee piakken gesneden zodat wanneer je ze naast
elkaar legde er een geheel te znen was Toen begon het moei
lijkste deel de taart in partjes verdelen Het lukte haar
aardig Jeder kreeg een tamelijk stuk Het smaakte naar
het Augustinus College
IS
Fuut fuuuuut Jan hcorde het afgesproken sein buiten
Hijpakte zijn hengel en bijbeherende spullen en mompelde een
Mtct strafes Met Piet zou hij vanavond bij Barcadera gaan
vissen Ze stapten samen voort in de richting van de haven
A spcedig verveelden ze zich want geen vis beet en ze
zochten daarom een andere plaats Plotseling zagen ze lichten
aan en uitgaan p zee Ncg meer verbaasden ze zich toen er
dichtbij een groot licht aanging Op hetzelfde ogenblik hoor
den ze vanachter de kistenTSohoct doe dat liht uit gebruil
de zaklantaarn Het licht kwam van een auto ve renders tel den
de twee jengens Nu hcorden ze tanuit de zee repenMaar twee
kisten pech gehad
Ze waren nu dichtbij en eventjes later gleed het bcotje
voorbij Jan en Piet hoorden heftig discussieren en se prefi
teerden vaja dit ogenblik Ze slopen naar de publieke telefon
die op het haventerrein hing Zachtjes maar vlug brachten ze
de politie op de hoogte en krepen daarna achter de kisten terug
De mannen bleken het nog steeds niet met elkaar eens te zijn
Maar eindelijk zagen de jsngens een auto in voile vaart
aankemen De sirene begon te lceien Achter de kisten hoorden
ze vloeken hier was geen ontsnappen meer aan De jtngens kwa
men pas tevoorschijn toen de mannen al geed gebeoid daar ston
den De agenten feliciteerden hen met hun krang optreden De
ze mannen bleken al lang aan de smokkelhandel mee te deen
Vcl trots keerden Jan en Piet naar huis terug De vol
gende morgen waren zij het middelpunt van belangstelling

bui en gaf ons veel huiswerk cp Hij zei dat we hoofdstuk
oefening B in het meervoud moesten zetten
Le volgende dag kwasn hij en zei tot onze verrassing dat wij
het in het meervoud moesten zetten en ook vertalen Maar
onze oren waren niet verstopt met Tjamt en we hadden hem
duidelijk horen zeggen hoofdstuk oefening Tt Nu kwam
hij met zijn verhaal van vertalen En wij maar protesteren
Een van de jongens zei dat meneer gelijk had Toen gaf hij
de hele klas straf

YA NO VEO A NADIE
La calle sola esta y todo es triste al ccmtemplar
Lugares que pase ayer hoy vuelvo a ver y nada hay
No ate que pasa pero tu estas lejas de mi
Y siento al recordar un gran dolor dentro de mi
Ya no veo a nadie no necesito a nadie
Mis ojos quieren verte a ti
En el mismo par que vi el banco aquel donde te ame
qua mo jo tus pies del mismo ric que veo correr
Que no hablen mas de amor no creo ya que pueda existir
U nadie nadie puede cambiar excepto tu ya mi vivir
Ya no veo a nadie
Hoy he vielto al mismo sitio que queda como nuestra altar
Y he pasado el puente donde soliamcs los dos erusar
Que no habdLen mas de amorno oreo ya que mi amor pueda existir
Ya yo que siempre pense que mi amor no iba a cabar
Baby baby baby baby
Ya no veo a nadie

Jil  VDe afspraak was om vier uur bij mij thuis Ik had mijn
huiswerlc afgemaakt en ging mijn nieuwe fiets tevoor schijn ha
len Eon poosje later kwam mijn vriend Jan Eerst legde hij mij
de verdiensten van de onderdelen uit Met een half cor luister
de ik Rijden wou ik
Jan reed nu de grotewsg op om de fiets zogenaamd te pro
beren Zijn ritje duurde me te lang en ik scheeuwde naar hems
THe hou op met je show ik wil ook een kans om hot te leren
Hij kwam terug en gaf me de fiets A dadelijk zat ik erop
maar ik durfde niet eens een voet van de grond te liohten Maar
rijden zou ik Ik trapte op het pedaal om daarna krachtig te
remmen Lachend probeerde ik het opnieuw Jan hield het stuur
vast en bevend kwam ik nu vooruit Langzaam reed ik de weg op
maar nauwelijks liet Jan hen stuur los of ik lag op de grond
Als er nu maar geen auto aankwamJ
moest ik een boohtje maken om terug te gaan Ik nam
die te scherp zodat ik een pooaje later langs de weg zat de
fiets naast me Een gevoelig plekje had het moeten ontgelden
De hoofdregel van het verkeer schoot me te binnen en ik
wist dat ik zo een gevaar voor het verkeer zou kunnen zijn
Jan hielp me met cpstaan en het spellefcje begon weer i een
oeetje rijden weer vallen Tens lotto had ik er genoeg van
Die avond sliep ik met meer builtjes

VIJFDE JAARGANG
MAART NUMMER
Beste abonnees
Allereerst vragen we jullie aandacht voor een bescheiden arti
keltje over het hoofd van La Salie College Het past wel bij
de bescheiden frre Arnold dat we er geen kolossaal feest van
gemaakt hebben maar leraren en leerlingen hebben hem toch
aardig verrast met zijn koper efeest waar hij zelf helemaal
niet aan gedacht had f
Dat meningen verschillen kun je zien aan de twee opstelletjes
ever ons schoolblad Welke mening delen jullie Maar ophouden
met dat tijdverknoeien of doorgaan met een leuk blad te ver
zorgen We maken in ieder geval de jaargang afl
Daarvoor rekenen we weer op jullie steun April is een korte
maand met een korte vakantie erin Lever je kopij nog in vr
de vrije dagen beginnen
En aan alle mulokandidaten ontzettend veel sukses op en
april bij het schriftelijk We duimen voor jullie
Redaktie iOp september werd fr Arnold hoofd van het
het St Dominicus College kopklassen Hij volgde fr Vin
cent ius op die haar Nederland werd geroepen om Provinciaal
te worden van alle Nederlandse freres
Fr Arnold was toen al bijna tien jaar op Aruba en
had al die tijd aan de kopklassen ls gegeven Hij was zon
officieus hoofd geweest van de hbsklassen die toen ver
bonden waren aan onze school en wel van tot Daar
was hij ock de man voor met zijn mo Engels mc wiskunde
en lo Frans zijn m oEsperanto rekenen we maar niet mee
was en is hijde knapste leraar aan La Salie
Vanaf het begin werkte hij hard voor de school en
vooral voor de leerlingen nieuwe bezems vegen schoon Maar
zijn ijver en zorg zijn nooit minder geworden Dat merken we
elke dag
Hij heeft een geweldige interesse voor alle jongens
Met zijn fabelachtig geheugenonthoudt hij ontzettend veel
namen en gezichten Geslaagden van hebben even erg zijn
belangstelling als die van straks Van heel velen weet
hij yhog wat ze waard waren op school Haal niets verkeerds
Uit op school want fr Arnold weet het over jaar nog Ook
het gede onthoudt hiji En wat er met de leerlingen gebeurt
na het verlaten van de school dat blijft hem voortdurend
interesserenIn die twaalf en een half jaar heeft fr Arnold
kandidaten zien slagen voor het mulodiploma En natuur
lijk ook een heleboel jongens zien weggaan zonder zon kost
baar documentje Yoor elk van hen stond hij klaar om te hel
pen met verdere studie of het zoeken naar werk
We tellen nu op onze school leerlingen Het hoofd
kent hen stuk voor stuk Van velen weet hij meer dan de jon
gens zelf denken Hij heeft misschien hun vader of grotere
broers in de klas gehad En wat hij dan ook zeker weets wie
waren de uitblinkers in wiskunde Maar dat vak is toch niet
het enige waar hij naar kijkt cm te weten wat een leerling
voor het leven waard is Maar de meoiteen extralessen die
hij gegeven heeft om iemand een lijn middendoor te laten de
len ziet hij graag beloond met een voldoende op het examen
Wat hij hiet liefst zou willen geven ESPEHAKCO Al
voor hij in zijn onderwijzersdiploma haalde was zijn
vurigste wens dat deze taal van dr Xamenhof DE wereldtaal
zou worden Dat ziet hij als een ideaal om ook wereldvrede
te kunnen hebben Stel je eens voor dat alle mensen zonder
moeite elkaar zouden kunnen verstaan Dat zou heel wat ver
keerd begrijpen uit de werdld helpen Als hij straks zijn
verdiend pensioen gaat krijgen voorzichtig begint hij daar
al aan te denken dan zal hij zich gelukkig voelen als hij
Esperanto kan propageren Geloof maar gerust dat de boeken
bonnen die leraren en leerlingen hem cadeau hebben gedaan
aan Esperantoboeken besteed zullen worden
De kalme viering op school van zijn koperen hoofd
schap is door leerlingen en leraren leuk gehe im A gehouden
zodat het voor fr Arncld een prettige verrassing is geweest
De kleine huldiging met bloemen sigaren en boekenbonnen
heeft hij wel verdiend Wij kunnen iemand die zich dagelijks
zc inspant voor onze school zeker nooit genoeg bedanken
Fr Arnold verdient onze dahkbaarheid bovenmate Hij moet
nog maar niet denken aan zijn pensioen en nog lang cp voor
de Arubaanse jeugd blijven werkenDie hevige kriebel in je kuiten als ouderen telkens weer
verontwaardigd spreken of schrijven over de jeugd van tegen
woordig kan ik me levendig indenken Ik zie die kuiten van
je kriebelen wil je dat wel geloven
Als we ons afvragen hoe was dat jaar geledeno of
jaar of jaar geleden Wel toen spraken of schreven de
toenmalige ouderen ook heel verontwaardigd over die jeugd van
tegenwoordig De jongemensen van jaar geleden zijn de
huidige grootvaders en grootmoeders on de jongens en meisjes
van jaar geleden dat zijn de huidige ouders die nu zelf
zo schuddebollen
Dat is dus allemaal een beetje om te lachen en tevens cm
te huilen maar met die opmerking is de zaak niet afgedaan
Wanneerwe het over dejeugd hebben dan bedoelen we ih hoofde
zaak de jeugd van ongeveer ten tot twintig jaar Zoals in alle
eeuwen voltrekken zich in deze jaren grote geestelijke en
lichamelijke veranderingen Een jongen die vroeger openhartig
met zijn ouders ever allerlei dingen praatte zal helaas vaak
over dat nieuwe in zijn leven zijn verhevigde belangstelling
voor meisjes de vuilbekkerij van schoolvrienden enz niet
met zijn vader durven of willen praten Daarover praat hij
of met niemand of met zijn vrienden Daaruit volgt dat het
voor de ouderen moeilijk is om te weten en te begrijpen wat
er in de harten en hoofden der jongeren omgaat
Een grote fout van vele ouders is dat ze hun kinderen
graag veel te lang als Onmondige hulpbehoevende onnozele kin
dertjes blijven beschouwen Ze klagen over de oppervlakkigheid
van de hedendaagse jeugd de losbandigheid komen met het
scheldwoord nozem en zo maar voort En dan nog beweren dat
deze ouderen een jaar of geleden net zc waren als wij
j onge re nvanvanda ag t
Er zijn wat uiterlijke verschillen De meisjes van nu
zijn niet meer de wat plompe nogal verlegen bakvissen die
jaar geleden door ons werden nagekeken De dikke sokken en
zware handschoenen van de meisjes hebben plaats gemaakt voor
ladderende nylons sierlijke of potsierlijke schoenen en de
plusfour van de jongens voor keurige herenpantal ons of spijker
broeken
Er zijn bromfietsen scooters en televisietoestellen ge
komen Maar de jeugd is weinig veranderd hoogstens wat braver
geworden dank zij de welvaart
Je moet niet kijken naar dat handjevol nozems en gillende
kantoormeisjes die de boel wel eens cp stelten aetten want
deze jeugd maakt maar een heel klein percentage uit van het
totaal
Ik hoop nu maar dat er wederzijds begrio mag ontstaan

mijn huiswerk maken Hst was niet veel Ik kon al gauw gaan
voetballen
Ik hoestte een beetje maar daar had ik al niet meer aan
gedacht fs Avonds teen ik terugkwam ging ik douchen en daarna
bij de televisie zitten Maar ik kon er niet eens naar kijken
want ik kreeg hoofdpijn het beste wat ik toen dcen Joon was
naar bed gaan
De volgende dag hoefde ik niet naar schoei want ik was
echt ziek Qn tien uur ging ik naar de dokter Daar hield ik
niet van Ik kreeg drie flesje medicijnen en de boodschap dat
iktenminste vier of vijf dagen in bed moest blijven Met dat
laatste was ik in de welken Stel je eens voor lekker te beden nog wel vier cf vijf dagen Dat is fijnJ
Toen ik thuis kwam at ik en ging meteen in bed Ik
viel nog meteen in slaap ook Die dag was gauw voorbij
De volgende dag stond ik vroeg op dronk mijn glas melk en
wilde naar buiten gaan maar dat was niet waar Moeder waar
schuwde me dat als ik naar buiten ging dat ik ook naar
school mees tl Dus ging ik maar weer te bed Ik nam een boek en
lag te lezen Om twaalf uur stond ik op en ging eten Daarna
weer lezen Ik had een prinsenleventjeBijna de hele dag lezen om twaalf uur en om vier wat eten
en de rest van de dag uitrusten Beter kun je het niet krij
gen Ik werd zo goed behandeld dat ik me ervoor begon te
schamen
Xl
De volgende dag was het weer hetzelfde liedje De hele dag
lezen eten drinken en slapen
In het begin vond ik het heerlijk thuis te blijven maar
de derde dag begon het al saai te worden Dag in dag uit
dezelfde dingen dcen is niet prettig Dan wilde ik toch lie
ver maar weer naar school
Ik wilde naar buiten om met mijn vrienden te spelen Nu
begonik te denken dat het toch niet prettig was de hele dag
thuis te moeten hangen De laatste twee dagen gingen heel
langzaam voorbij
Eindelijk mocht ik weer naar school Ik lachte in mijn
vuistje Weer buiten weer vrijmaar ook weer veel huis
werk en niet veel tijd om te spelen Daar had ik niet aan geEWELE QESFEVEHS OVER HET DOmINICUSCOLLEGELA SALLE COLLEGE

dat is in jaarAls een kind bij zijn vader cf moeder is voelt het
zich blij en gelukkig Waarom dan toch Wel omdat het zich
daar veilig voelt En er is niets of niemand die dit kind zou
kunnen overtuigen dat hij een veiliger plaats weet waar nie
mand je kwaad kan doen
Alle mensen zijn eens kind geweest Er is niemand
groot geboren Ik ben een teenager K Soms denk je bij je
zelf ik ben geen kind meer ik ben groot en sterk Maar daar
bega je een fout Want zolang je nog onder je ouders bent
thuis word je als kind beschouwd
Doms denk je was ik maar nooitop de wereld geko
men Dan hoefde ik niemand kwaad op mij te laten worden
Als je ziet wat er om je heen gebeurt dan denk je
ik ben toch de enige niet die verdrietig kan zijn
Sommige ouders hebben thuis ruzie met elkaar Ze
trekken zich er niets van aan wat ze tegen elkaar zeggen ter
wijl hun kinderen erbij staan Het kind dat alles hoort be
gint dan te twijfelen aan het respevt dat het voor vader en
moeder meet hebben Dit kingl meent dan het recht te hebben
om op te staan en tegen te spreken Want als dat niet gebeurt
wordt alles nog veel erger
n kind heeft een vader en moeder nodig om het de
weg door dit moeilijke leven te wijzen en om het voor de vel
gevaren die er zijn te behoeden Maar als er telkens ruzie is
tussen de ouders van zofn kind dan Jnoet het wel de verkeerde
kant uitgaan
Een kind dat pijn of verdriet heeft reept altijd
om moeder En daar is ze toch ook voor Ze is toch jouw moe
der Maar als je geen moeder hebt cm wie moet je dan roepenJe vader heeft nooit tijd Hij heeft het altijd te druk met
zijn eigen zaken En daardoor zie je dat een kind zender moe
der anders is dan een dieiflel een vader en een moeder heeft
gekend
Zijn vader en moeder om een of andere reden gescheiden
en het kind hoorde en zag wat er gebeurde dan zal dit in op
stand komen tegen alle andere mensen Dit komt omdat het het
verdriet en het leed in zich heeft van het gebeurde en daarom
zal het iedereen die in zijn leven wil komen afstoten
In de Bijbel staat geschreven eert uw vader en uw moe
der opdat uw dagen verlengd worden sn het Koninkrijk des Her
ren Kan dit eren altijd maar doorgaan
Kinderen in de leeftijd van tot jaar kun je niet
meer zo maar enderrichten Ze weten dan alles zelf beterEn
kinderen die zoveel verdriet gekend hebben toen ze klein wa
ren worden straks ook vader en moeder Door de opvoeding die
zij gekregen hebben gaan ze misschien later ook zc doen En
hun kinderen zouden ook als zij zelf kunnen cpgroeien Dat
wordt dan in elke generatie slechter
Hoe voornaam is het dan niet dat er goede ouders zijn
Als iedereen maar zijn verantwoordelijkheid besefte

betekent dat er hard gewerkt moet worden om die tot
een goed einde te brengen Er gebeurt dus niets

maart De zuidkant van onze school bij de wcs oefent
een grote aantrekkingskracht uit op een aantal jon
gens van en die zich officieel aan de noord
kant moeten bevinden Fr Arnold is dan telkens
weer zo goed hen eraan te herinneren
maarts De centrale proefwerken waren helemaal niet voor
de poes dat kon je wel merken als het pauze was
Iedereen praatte honderduit over zijn werk en de
fouten die hij had laten zitten
De e klassers vonden het Spaans wel een beetje al
te hard Meneer Rosenstand u bent wel goed voor
een eindexamenklas Spaans maar spaar ons toch tot
we daar zijn
maart Frhe Arnold is bijna twaalf en een half jaar hoofd
op onze school en dat laten we niet ongemerkt voor
bijgaan Gezamenlijk wordt er een aktie op touw ge
zet Het begint natuurlijk met het inzamelen van
geld En wel zo dat de feesteling er niks van merktV
Natuurlijk kan een hoofd niet bij alle leerlingen
even geliefd zijn maar er werd toch een mooi be
j drag bijeen gebracht De meesten toonden hun goed
hart
maart De dag van fr Arnold is er Een receptie staat
niet op het programma en daarom verdringen de leer
lingen zich al voor school om de ngood old man
geluk te wensen
Om tien uur was het verzamelen op de speelplaats
Speeches een kistje sigaren en cadeaubonnen De
bloemen bleven natuurlijk ook niet achterwege op
deze dag Ze kwamen van vele kanten
fs Middags genoten we vaneen fantastische film in
het De Veer theater
Fr Arnold als ik dit in het ESPERANTO kon zeggen
dan had ik het zeker gedaan Hartelijk gefelici
teerd namens de hele redaktie
maart Meneer Zonjee vertrok naar de overkant Venezuela
om de bridgekleuren van Aruba Hoog te houden Wie
weet als hij terugkomt spreekt hij alleen maar
Spaans
En d boft er maar mee Meneer Zonjee wil nooit
ziek worden en nou hebben ze toch een buiten
kansje En maandag is onze meneer nog niet terug

Om in Rusland benzine te kopen moet u eerst naar een regering
bureau cm een couponboekje te halen vervolgens gaat u naar
een benzinestation dat staatseigendom is Daar maakt u een
schatting hoeveel benzine u nodig hebt geeft de bonnetjes
aan de bediende en vult dan zelf uw tankWe hebben op school een krant die Bao di Kwihi heet
Die naam past wel op de voorpagina want er staat een kwxhi
bdom en onder die kwihiboom zitten een paar jongens en meis
JfeS Toch vind ik die krant niets waard Ik vind Bao di
Kwihi een saaie krant wat ze erin schrijven zijn allemaal
maar kletspraatjes Soms staan er verhalen in die niet goed
zijn voor grote jongens en meisjes Die verhalen zijn bestemd
voor kleine kinderen Het lijken net sprookjes es wa ze
erin schrijven zijn altijd verhalen over een gekke oekomst
of bijna altijd een droom
Volgens mij moeten ze spannende verhalen og vervolg
verhalen erin zetten n i
De grapjes die erin staan zijn ock mets waard Degeneh
die de grapjes erin zetten denken dat de lezers er heel vee
om moeten lachen  jq
Vinden de redactieleden en hun leider zelf met
Bao di Kwihi niets waard is Waarom besteden ze hun tijd aan
zon onnozele krant
Ik abonneerde me maar en jaar op die krant Volgen
mij zetten meestal de meisjes van het Maria College die kles
praatjes erin
Er moeten nieuwe redaktieleden en een nieuwe leider
komen
De beste paginas die in Bao di Kwihi staan zijn ten
eerste de laatste bladzijde die is het interessantst want
daar staan altijd puzzels ik houd van puzzels
Ten tweede de paginas waar tophits staan Maar soms staan
er liedjes bij die geen tophit meer zijn
De hele rest van die krant moet weggegooid worden die
deugt voor niets
Ik zou de meningen van de leraren wel eens willen we
ten Voor mij deugt die krant niet
Sn dit was mijn opinie over onze schoolkrant
Centraalproefwerkcpstels c
DT
teWij hebben een schoolblad dat Bao di Kwihi heet Daarin
werken we samen met de jongens van La Salie College het is
een erg leuk blad Als je in je vrije tijd erin zit te blade
ren kun je je echt amuseren Ik lees het altijd van a tot z
Op de eerste bladzijde is de redaktie aan het woord Dan
volgen artikelen van jongens enmeisjes Soms ook ban leraren
of leraressen maar niet elke keer Die opstellen zijn dik
wijls heel leerzaam Zo heeft er een heleboel ingestaan over
gemengde scholen Iedereen kon daar gewoon over schrijven wat
hij of zij ervan dacht De jongens en meisjes schijnen het
wel te willen dat de scholen gemengd worden Maar als de hoof
den van s cholen niet willen gaat dat feest voorlopig nog niet
door
Dan komen de journaals van Maria en La Salie College Die
zijn meestal heel leuk geschreven Wat er gebeurd is weten we
dikwijls zelf wel maar het is toch grappig om dat nog eens
na te lezen Zo komen we ook heel wat te weten van eikaars
scholen Als je zo somsper ongeluk de bijnaam van een leraar
tegenkomt kun je over de vloer tollen van het lachen
Daarachter komen nog meer opstellen die ingestuurd zijn
Dikwijls korte grappige verhalen Ik geloof als je ze goed
leest dat je er nog heel wat van kunt leren om zelf ook goede
opstellen te leren schrijven
En dan komt onze tiener rubriek met de tophits van de
maand Dat moeten ze nooit overslaan En op de laatste pagina
vind je een kruiswoordpuzzel of een song Quizz Daar zijn leuk
prijsjes mee te winnen maar ik heb nog nooit geluk gehad
Als je dan nog ziet hoe de redaktieleden hun best gedaan
hebben cm hier en daar een leuke tekening te zetten dan be
grijp ik wel dat zij er heel veel moeite voor hebben moeten
doen o
Wij zijn trots op ons tijdschrift We hopen dat de redac
tieleden hun best blijven doen om het steeds beter te doen
worden VKTOEN HIJ ME IN DE STEEK LIET
We liepen in de regen gearms Carlos en ik Ik
peinsde nog over Ludivik Hij liet me in de steek voor een
meisje dat misschien maar een dubbeltje nee minder waard
was Hij hij  werd verliefd op haar zwarte ogen
We hadden het zo goed samen en nu is hij er vandoor
gegaan met die die bah Ik schudde dienare gedachte
van me af Carlos keek me van opzij aan Cividrch zit jt
weer aan die stommeling te denken Wat je allemaal doorstaan
hebt is hij nit waard Geen jongen is dat waard Vergeet
hem Civi asjeblief
Ik glimlachte hem toe Dank je Carlos ik ik
kan het niet helpen Ze hebben me ervoor gewaarschuwd en
toch Zwijgend liepen we verder Zonder doel Opeens werd
Carlos omarming steviger Ik keek hem aan en volgde zijn
blik Daar kwamen ze aan Ludivik en die die
Ze liepen luidruchtig te praten en te babbelen Hij
fluisterde haar iets in het oor Ze brulden het uit Carlos
zei tegen mij Civi je moet niet bang zijn Hij is het ze
ker niet waar d Alsof we al goeie dikke vrienden waren leg
de ik mijn arm ook om Carlos heen net zoals een verloofd
paartje het zou doen
Carlos fluisterde me iets in ik deed alsof het heel
leuk was en lachte met geveinsd plezier Toen keek Ludivik om
Tasania ook Hij zei spottend Ifet is ofje niet zonder jon
gen kunt Ik werd rood nee paars Ik zou hem wel hebben
kunnen vermoorden Ik deed een stap naar voren om hem op
zijn gezicht te meopen maar Carlos hield me tegen Ik ant
woordde rood van woede Jullie jullie bah juli iepassen
hij elkaar Jullie zijn van hetzelfde soort en bovenoien kan
ik het zo veel jongens krijgen als ik maar wil Kom Carlos
laten we geen woorden aan die snertmensen vuil maken
Ik nam Carlos bij de hand en we liepen verderIk was zo beledigd zo zo dat ik de hele
wereld zou hebben kunnen doodschieten de hle wereld
Bij een lantaarnpaal bleven we staan Ik kon het
niet meer uitftouden en barstte in tranen uit Carlos asje
blief vergeef me vergeef me Hij kon mijn woorden bijna
niet verstaan Civi je hebt je flink gehouden en dat is het
voornaamste Kop op meisje Ik kan je niet helpen dit moet
je alleen uitvechten met je zelf
Ik droogde mijn tranen en gaf zijn zakdoek terug
Dank je Hst gaat over Bet mt overgaan Bet mt
Civi ik ben altijd bij je om te helpen Ik zal op je wachten
al duurt het mijn hele leven Je kunt op mij rekenen altijd
dat weet je
Wij liepen verder zwijgend het donker in ieder
met zijn eigen gedachten

het examen hebben een zware tijd Je kunt niet gezellig uit

Mi lucha para alcanzar la victoria como cantante no
fue facil Fueron anos de trabajo ensayando musica can
tando en boites sin dinero en el bolsillo sufrlendo hu
millaeiones
Cuando era adolescents iba de vcs en cudndo a Rio
de Janeiropara tenter suerte En aquel tiempo nadie tenia
fe en la llamada musica joven Robertc Corte Real me
recibio bien Hizo una exper iencia conmigo pidio que can
tara todos los generos
Queria saber que era loque yo debia grabar Y ter
ming quedandome en lo que hoy canto El exito en si comen
zo en Sac Paulo Y con el vinieron las complicaciones y
algun dinero
Sumandolo todo supongo que soy un sujeto con
suerte Ahora mi proxima etapa es el cine Siempre tuve
intension de hacer cine No me creo actor pero tengo
mucha fierza di voluntad ffero mi obsesion siempre sera
la musica Amo todas las musicas Muchos han hablado mal
de mi Fbro yo hago musica no tengo nada comtra nadir
iVJe gusta la libertad la libertad de un pais como
Inglaterra donde todos andan como quiereny nadie los cri
tica Y opino que como en la ropa en la musica tambien
debe haber libertad
Debemos cantar todo aquello que nos parezca bonito
En fin cada quien tiene su gusto Siempre duermo hasta la
tarde Por la noche me quedo conversando oon los amigos
escuohando musica y a yeces compqniendo
Be levanto muy tarde La tarde para mi es el dinamismo La noche es suave
Me han preguntado si tengo miedo de envejecer
No ningun miedo No repruebo al viejo que se une a una
muchacha de veinte anos Claro cjue algunas veces el viejo
se pone ridicule al proceder asi Lo importante es sentir
algo Cuando el viejo es realmente viejo ahi si que todo
muere Ahi el no puede ni siquiera mirar una rosa

ilfeel lang geledenwoonde er eens een getrouwd paar in
een klein huisje aan een knoekoeweg Ze leefden gelukkig
maar hadden geen kinderen De man was een los arbeider en
knapte nu eens hier dan weer daar een karweitje op
Op zekere dag trok hij er met zijn hengel en mand op
uit met de gedachte zijn vtouw eens met flink wat vis te
verrassen Bij de zee gekomen zocht hij eerst een goed
plekje bij cocospalmen en daar ging hij zitten
Hij wilde net zijn hengel uitgooien toen hij een
eindje verderop iets zag blinken in het zand Hij kon zijn
nieuwgierigheid niet bedwingen en stond dus weer op ging
naar het blinkend voorwerp toe en raapte het voorzichtig
op Toen hij er echter op keek schrok hij zich een hoedje
Alle mensen riep hij uit maar dat is een af
beelding van wijlen mijn vaderJ Wat een toeval dat net ik
zijn zoon het hsb gevonden Wat een toeval wat een toeval
Dat moet ik goed bewaren en niemand hoeft te weten dat ik
het in mijn bezit heb En hij plofte weer neer op zijn
uitgezocht plekje en wierp zijn hengel uitNa een uur of twee keerde hij gewapend met het Tpor j
tret en een mand vol vissen naar zijn huisje terug Hij
gaf zijn vrouw de vissen en zette koers naar zijn kamer
Daar trok hij een la van zijn kast open maakte die hele
maal leeg stofte die goed uit en legde er watten in Nog
eenmaal keek hij naar het portret kuste het en legde het
voorzichtig tussen de watten Zorgvuldig duwde hij de la
terug en ging naar buiten
Van die dag af ging hij elke morgen en elke avond
naar die kamer nam het portret eruit kuste het en stopte
het weer weg Natuurlijk merkte zijn vrouw dat hij geheimzin
nig deed en ze besloot de volgende morgen eens te proberen
of ze kon zien wat hij toch in zijn s child voerde
De volgende morgen toen de man zich weer in de kamei
bevond stond de vrouw voor de deur en gluurde door het sleu
telgat Verwonderd zag de vrouw dat haar echtgenoot een voor
werp in zijn handen nam er teder naar keek het kuste en het
weer op zijn plaats legde Na zijn vrouw gegroet te hebben
stapte hij de deur uit en vertrok
Toen dewrouw hem de deur uit zag gaan en hij een
eindje weg was ijlde ze naar de kamer trok de la open en
pakte het voorwerp Verbaasd keek ze in een vrouwengezicht
Zo daar kijkt mijn man nu elke dag naar Een vrouw zozol
En notabene een lelijke kijk die tanden eens uitsteken en
wat een haren Mijn mop is nog wel beterJ Maar wacht maar man
netje met jou heb ik nog een appeltje te schillen
Toen de man Ts avonds argeloos zijn huisje binnen
kwam vond hij niet als altijd zijn vrouw aan tafel met n
lekker maal voor zich Ze stond aan tafel en voor een lege
tafel TZo vrouwtje gaan we vandaag in een restaurant eten
Zoals ik zie Ja in een restaurantl Eaar heb je haar ze
ker ontmoet En haar portret maat kussen hei Ja ik ben nog
niet stom hoori Ik heb je door jochie Je kunt de rest maar
beter opbiechtenI schreeuwde de vrouw
Vrouw vrouw wat heb je toch Over welke haar en
portret heb je het toch Doe niet zo weeigl Je weet het
best Die stomme vrouw met uitstekende tanden die je elke dag
in de kamer staat te zoenenl Maar dat is het portret van mijr
overleden vaderi Hoe kun je zo over een dode praten Het werd
een kabaal van jewels te in het huisje
Toevallig kwam net de pastoor voorbij en hij kwam op
het lawaai afZe deden beiden hun verhaal
Breng maar hier dat portret zei de pastoor De mar
gaf het hem en de pastoor keek erop

Ons verlof ligt al weer meer dan een maand achter ons
encns leventje hier op Aruba loopt weer in het oude gareel
Nu word ik gevraagd iets voor Bao d Kwihi te schrijven
Maar wat lets over mijn verlof Wat interesseert jullie
New York
Het is een geweldige stad Ik ben er maar drie dagen
met mijn gezin geweest zodat jullie geen nauwkeurige be
schrijving van die stad van mij moeten verwachtenc Bovendien
kun je zo iets in allerlei reisgidsen vinden
Sta mij dan toe all een maar een klein voorvalletje
te vertellen waardoor je kunt zien voor welke moeilijkheden
een huisvader en moeder kunnen komen te staan wanneer zij
met vier kinderen tussen en jaar zon tooht maken
We kwamen fs avonds pas tegen tien uur in New York
aan omdat we die dag veel tijd verlorenhadden in het zie
kenhuis van Washington waar het gipsverband van mijn zoon
tje gecontroleerd moest worden
De kinderen zaten nu rustig in do auto We wist en dat
ons hotel in Manhatten lag bij de Fifth Avenue en we wisten
dat New York erg groot is Toen we voor de eerste keer de weg
vroegen bleken we in Harlem te zijn Het was niet zo erg
druk zodat we rustig konden luisteren naar een vriendelijke
donkere man die ons de weg wees
De Fifth Avenue is een zeer bekende weg Daarliggen
veel grote bekende wolkenkrabbers oca het EmpiiPSaBfiilding
We hadden die avond echter geen tijd cm daar naar te kijken
De kinderen moesten naar bed In Manhatten is bijna overal
eenrichtingverkeer zodat je niet zo maar een straat in kantslaan maar vaak een hele oirrweg moet maken voor je de plaats
van bestemming kunt bereiken Ons hotel lag in de th straat
bij de Fifth Avenue We hadden veel bagage bij ons Dat moest
eerst allemaal uitgeladen worden waarna ik de auto snel
moest verwijderen Het parkeerprobleem is een van de moeilijke
problemen in New York
Het hotel was tjokvol De receptionist kreeg nog re
gelmatig per telefoon aanvragen binnen maar iedereen moest
afgezegd worden Wij kregen onze kamers toegwezen Ergens heel
hoog Met de lift werden we naar boven gebracht We kregen
twee grote kamers met badkamer maar de tv en de radio deder
het slecht De airco deed het wel eh dat was ook wel nodig
want alle ramen waren dichtgemo beeJ jschilderd dwz men had
de verf overal zo dik opgesmeerd dat de ramen niet meer open
konden
Ik probeerde de airco iets zachter te zetten maar
toeh viel de hele boel uit Wij aan het bellen maar niemand
in het hotel had verstand van aircoTs en een monteur was pas
de volgende dag te krijgen Mopperen hielp niets
Uit vrees voor een te vroege verstikkingsdood hebben
we toen maar de deur naar de gang opengezet We hebben het
overleefdi
Natuurlijk hebben we ook wel interessante dingen in
New York gezien maar Aruba is toch frisser

hoofdredakteur
Frankie Kuiperi
Met stijgende verbazing heb ik het artikeltje van DT
over ons schoolblad in het vorige nummer gele zen Eat was pas
een echt kletspraatje want wat dat jochie schreef was niets
dan afbrekende kritiek Hier wil ik enkele woorden tot hem
richten
zegt dat je nBao di Kwihi een saaie krant vindt
met sprookjes die niet pas sen voor grote jongens en meisjes
Nou lees het dan niet jij bent toch te groot voor zofn kleu
terkrantje Koop een spannend boek en amuseer je ermee Wij
lezen BdK met genoegen
m Je schrijft dat het meisjes zijn die die kletspraatjesschrijven Maar jochie vergeet niet dat alleen deze meisjes
hun mening en opstel durven schrijven Als zij deze klets
praatjes niet zouden schrijven dan zou BdK nog dunner van om
vang zijnEn vergeet ook niet dat deze krant voor ons is en
dus ookdoor ons moet worden volgeschreven En met ans wor
den niet alleen de meisjes bedoeld
Je kritiek over de grapjes is helemaal misplaatst
Die grapjes zijn wel amusant maar misschien heb jij liever
minderwaardige grapjes
Je meent dat er nieuwe redaktieleden moeten komen
word jij dan de leider en neem een paar maanden voor
proef Ik zie je al die opstellen die binnenkomen afkeuren
daar se volgens jou te kinderachtig zijn Als dat manner dan
verschijnt zou ik weleens willen zien hoveel opstellen erin
staan en of ze wel spannend zijn
I
Je schrijft verder dat je je rear een jaar op die
krant hebt geabonneerd Toch schijn je wel de tegenwoordige
BdE te lezen want je spreekt zelf van de tophits die erin
verschijnen en daar is de redaktie pas deze jaar gang mee be
gonncn Toch amusant he Enkele bladzijden
Nou jochie ik heb zelf genoeg van mijn kletspraatje
maar ik hoop dat je een volgende keer niet evenvcel gaat over

De laatste loodjes wegen het zwaarst en dat geldt ook voor
ons maandblad Tooh kregen we weer aardig wat binnen Ga zo
door Er komt nog een nummer
De redaktie doet haar best een geschikte datum te vinden on
een afscheidsfeest te vieren voor de tiendeklassers Houden
jullie het eerste weekend van juli vrij We proberen het in
die week op vrijdag klaar te krijgen
juni beginnen de laatste lcodjes voor de tienders Er wordt
enorm geblokt door sanmigen anderen schijnen al vol ver
trouwen te zijn We rekenen er in ieder geval p twee heel
lange lijsten met geslaagden te mogen publioeren in ons vcl

UITSLAG VAN DE W I S K U N D E fl My
xy zxyx zyx zyx zyxyzxy zxy zxy zxy zx
De opgave luidde
Een man en een vrouw zijn smaes jaar
Hij is tweemaal zc oud als zij was toen hij zO oud was als
zij nu is Hoe oud is elk
Een correctieconmissie bestaande uit een lid de verzameiing
is dus niet leeg geachte toekomstige leerlingen Vn de Brtig
klas vond van de oplossingen juist
Inderdaad is hij jaar en zij maar
Als de uitkomst wel juist was maar de manier was niet aan
gegeven of onjuist is de oplossing buiten beschouwing gela
ten zoals in het letters tellende reglement vermeld stondc
Hier volgt de oplossing
Stel de leeftijd van de man op x jaar en de leeftijd van de
vrouw op y jaar dan vinden we als eerste vergelijking
x fjrs l
Uit de tekst blijkt toen hij zo oud was als zij nu is
dat x groter is dan y Het verschil in leeftijd is dus y
Zij is nu y jaar Toen hij y jaar was was zij y xy
dat is x y jaar
Zijn tegenwoordige leeftijd is keer zo groot dus is de
twe e de ve rge i j king
x s x Vy of x x y of x y s
We hebben dus x y  volgt uit l
en x y
y
y s Dan is x
Dus de man is jaar en de vrouw is jaar
Opmerking
Sanmigen beginnen zo Stel de leeftijd van de man op x jaardan is de vrouw  x jaar enz Dat is natuurlijk ook
goed en dan heeft men maar een vergelijking nodig
Een andere oplossing is rneer schematised en ziet er als volgt
uit Stel de leeftijd van de vrouw op x jaar De man is p jaar
ouder dus hij is x f p jaar
De eerste vergeijking is x p
Qm de tweede verge lijking te vinden maken we het volgende
s chema
Hij
Zij
Nu
x p
X
Toen
X
x P
De vergeijking wordt
of x p
Dus we hebben
p s x p of x t p s x p
x p
x p
p  p  x is dan
Dus zij is jaar oud en hij
NB De volgende oplossing is fout maar zo goochelachtig dat
het toch wel leuk is het eens te horen
Als de man en de vrouw even oud waren zou elk jaar zijn
kun je mooi door delen Tel nu bij en je hebt de
leeftijd van de man namelijk jaar En trek af van en
je hebt de leeftijd van de vrouw namelijk jaar De proef
cp de som wigst uit dat het antwoord goed is

LuisPaula LSC aBroodslanke Twiggy staat nog steeds aan de top van de inter
nationale modellen Zij reist de hele wereld af poseert te
gen overvlcedige honoraria voor de fotografen maar blijft
volgens haar moeder een doodeenvoudig bescheiden meisje dat
haar eigen bed yjpmaakthelp bijde afwas en niets liever
r doet dan thuis zitten Zij is nu achttien jaar en heeft al een
aardig kapitaaltje bij elkaar gespaard dat haar vader als ln
ware Cerberus bewaakt
i
uEigenlijk heet ze Lesley Hornby maar u kent haar beter als
Twiggy U rnoet me niet kwalijk nemen wanneer ik me vergis
I en het over Lesley heb Want zo noemen we haar thuis nog al
tijd
Ze woog ongeveer vijf pond bij haar geboorte Een klein maar
prachtig gevormd kindje Net een pop Ze had grote ogen de
grootste die je je kunt vGorstellen Er zijn tegenwoordig
kranten die schrijven dat ze grijs zijn Anderen weten te ver
tellen dat Twiggy groenen ogen heefto Maar ik zeg ze zijn
blauw
Twiggy is altijd mager geweest Nu ja misschien niet altijd
Als baby was ze wel klein nietmager Hoe zou ze anders ooit
een prijs in een babyshow hebben gewonnen Een derde prijs
Ze was toen tien maanden oud Of ze goed eet Jfeer dan dat
Ze is dol op eten En allqs wat ik haar voorzet gaat erin
Makkelijk is ze daarbij ook Ik hoef nooit te denken dit of
dat lust ze niet want ze lust alles En dik is ze er niet
van geworden Je zou haast zeggen integendeeli
Op schopl noemden de meisjes haar Stokkie Ik denk dat ze
in dat opzicht op haar vader lijkt Ook zo een die kan eten
als een hollebolle Grijs maar dik worden ho maar
Ik was eens in een groot Londens warenhuis waar ik haarvlech
ten te koop zag liggen Er hing een grote foto van Twiggy die
een vlecht droeg nZc hoor je ze te drage n hoorde ik de ver
koopster zeggen terwijl ze naar de foto weeSo tNou vindt u
niet dat ze er schattig uitziet Ik had haast wiilen zeggen
Natuurlijk vind ik dat ik ben haar moeder Maar daar ben ik
te verlegen voor i
Onze hele familie timmert trouwens niet graag aan de weg zelfs
Tviggy is bescheiden van aard Dat durf ik als haar moeder
gerust te zeggen Op al die fotoTs die ze van haar maken mag
ze er verschrikkelijk elegant enwereldwijs uitzien maar thuis
is ze een s chat van een jongste dochter eigenlijk een kind nog
Roken doet ze niet Drinken evenmin Ze gaat nooit dansen en u
zult haar ook nooit in een nachtclub zien De meeste avonden
als ze niet voor haar werk op re is is brengt ze rustig thuis
door e
Bet is net of ze door haar werk huiselijker is geworden Want
vier Jzaar geleden toen ze veertien was trok ze er vaak met
haar vriendinnen op uit Toen waren de Beaties haar idolen
Gek was ze van die Beaties En nu Ze is over die period heenk
Wat zouden al die mensen die haar bewonderen cp die fotoTs
verbaasd opkijken als ze haar een avondje thuis meemaakten
Ze legt een kaartje met mijn man ze kijkt naar de televisie
ze amuseert zich met onze angorakat Binky of met Brett de
hond een vuilnisbakkenras maar een onbetaalbare grapjas
Del op dieren zijnwe allemaal feestal iigt Twiggy cm tien uur
in bed Ze staat om half acht of acht uur ope Voor haar make
up heeft ze minstens een uur nodig Zodra ze het bed uit is
zet ze haar platenspeler aan Geen dag begint voor haar zonder
muziek Tegenwoordig draait ze veel jazz en klassieke muziek
Wat de popmusic betreft daar is ze langzamerhand bovenuit ge
groeid Ze maakt keurig haar eigen bed op TsAvcnds helpt ze
me altijd met de vaat Ik was zij droogt af
vervolg op bizLaat maarJ
Ifet is waar
schijnlijk
voor mij
Wat mpet ik doen
kapitein Lit is fle eerste
keer dat zoiets gebeurt bij
de basisoefeningenvervolg van biz
ja ik mag toch niet verge ten te vertellen dat Lesley ik
bedoel Twiggy graag snoept Grote hoeveelheden bonbons en
dergelijke werkt ze met smaak naar binnen Je zou zeggen fat
find moet toc wel een hoge tandartsrekening hebben Maar
iiks hoorj ze tieeft een fantastsch goed gebit dat geregeld
floor de tandars wordt geccntroleerd
tk ben een Jrzfcie moeder en bewaar alle fotofs die van mijin
jongste forden gemaakt Eerst sehafte ikeenalbum aan maar
at is tl lang vol Mu bewaar ik gewcon a He kranten en tijd
SchriHen waarin haar foto staat En als ik die stapel zie
enk i dikwijls Wat is ons leven veranderdj wat is het alle
Vaal hel anders geworden dan wij mijn man en ik hadden
gedaet
fet ieg ik niet met spijt o nee we zijn heel blij met met
die grandering en vergeet u niet dat het in het begin wel w
nnn was Teen enze drie dochters jein waren was het thuis
aiitjd rumoerig vcoral als er vrienden en vriendinnetjes bij
waren U kent dat trouwens evengoed als ik Ik hield van al
dat gelach en gegiechel om me heenc Maar kleine kinderen wor
den groot en toen de twee oudsten trouwden en Twiggy bijna
van school was werd het stil in huis
Kijk dat vend ik niet plezierig Ik miste de drukte van die
opgroeiende kinderenc Weet u ze houden je jong En tegen
woordig Bet is drukker in huis dan ooit Voortdurend rinkelt
de telefoon Er wordt gebeld uit Duitsland uit Barijs uit
New Tork Soms spreken die mens en daarginds in zofn gebroken
Engels dat ik er geenwoord van begrijp

als de lessenaar daar niet gestaan had zou ik zeker gevallen
zijn Toen pas bemerkte ik datver geen leraar coor de lesse
naar stond Nu hoorde ik ook de jongens mcmpelen over een
vrije dag Ook zag ik enkelen bij de deur eh ramen staan
Die keken of de direkteur al op komst was am ons te zeggen
datwe vrij hadden
Hij kwam inderdaad en zei dat we piaar huis konden gaan daar
de klasonderwijzer ziekwas De direkteur was nauwelijks uit
gepraat of we storm den de klas al uit We renden de trap in
allerijl af maar owee daar gebeurde het al
Iemand gaf me een zet van achteren en ik verloor hierdoor
mijn eyenwicht zodat ik van de trap viel Ik rolde tot aan
de voet van de trap en daar belandde tenslotte mijn tas op
mijn hoofd
Nog een beet je suf van de val stond ik op nam mijp tas in
mijn hand en liep verder Toen ik thuiskwam gooide ik mijn
tas in een hoek van de kamer en ging uit met mijn fiets Ik
reed naar eenvriend en stelde hem voor om eeh fietstochtje
te gaan maken Hij stemde toe en een poos je later waren we
cp weg
We bezochteh vele plekjes op ons eiland maar bet was intus
sen laat geworden We trapten daarcm flink door om nog voorhet middagmaal thuis te zijn Onderweg kwamen we achter een
vrachtauto te rijden We probeerden erachter te blijven want
zb Icon de windons niet hinderen Wanneer de vrachtwagen har
der reed trapten we ook harder en zo bleven we er vocrtdurend
achter Zo zullen we gauw thuis zijn dacht ik bij rnezelf
Iar plotseling gebeurde iets onverwachts De vrachtwagen rem
de krachtig af en wij die er vlak achter reden konden onmo
gelijk een botsing vermijden Met een daverende klap reden we
tegen de truck aan Ik verloor het bewustzijn en had een lich
te hersenschudding opgelcpen Hiervoor moest ik enkele weken
in held blijven
Mijn vriend was er met een bult op zijn voorhoofd vanaf geko
men In mijn bed liggend dacht ik na Als we langzaam gereden
hadden zou er geen ongeluk gebeurd zijn Het is allemaal de
schuld van die haast die we hadden

Er leefde eens een man die heel graag wilde sterven Er werd
altijd zoveel moois oxer de hemel verteld dat hij graag eens
een kijkje ndaar boven wilde nemen Hij was waarschijnlijk
niet helemaal bij zijn poritieven
Wel zei hij hoe kom ik daar terecht Ha daar vechten
twee matrczen met Hessen Als ik er tussendoor ren zal een
van die messen mij wel goed genoeg raken Zo gezegd zo
gedaan In voile vaart rende hij er tussandoor Maar de files
sen waren van plastic de matrozen w aren namelijk aan het
trainen wat was onze man teleurgesteldo
Maar hij gaf de meed niet op Daar kwam een treih aanrijden
Als ik op de rails ga liggen ben ik er zeker aan schoot
door zijn hoofd Hij strekte zich languit op de rails Nu
zou hij wel sterven Maar de machinist had hem al van ver af
gezien en wist de trein op tijd tct stilstand te brengen
Hopeioos gestemd strompelde onze broekeman verder en kwam
bij een hotel Een nieuw plannetje schoot hem tebinnen Als
hij eens vanaf de bovenste verdieping sprong Danms ie ze
ker op slag dood Hij had geluk Er was een kamer vrlj cp de
bovenste verdieping Vrolijk stapte hij in de lift Hij lachf
te tegen alle mensen die hij tegenkwam Boveh stapte hij
meteen het balkon op Hij spreidde zijn armen uit eh glide
Daar ga ik Hij tuimelde naar beneden Een onschuldig boer
tje dat met een kar hooi langs kwam hoorde dat er een vracht
je meer op zijn kar viel Onze held dacht dat hij Hood was
en dat er een heleboel engelen ck hem heen stonden Hij werd
wakker geschud door het boertje en toen merkte hij dat hij
nog leefde loen pasbegreep hij dat dit de wereld was waar
hij leven moest Hu wilde hij niet meer sterven VToOpstellen maken was voor mij een niet al te grote kunst Je
kain zeggen dat ik er de knepen wel van ken Fantaseren vind
ik niet zc een twee drie het beste punt om een opstel mee
te versieren
Op school ben ik altijd de beste van de klas geweest in het
maken van opstellen Taal was en is n steeds een van mijn
ievel ingsvakken Maar wat geeft et als je na al die jaren
gosd geweest te zijn een cijfer voor je taal of opstel krijgt
dat beneden peil is Wie zou dan niet denken Wie is er nou
niet geed snik jij of de onderwijzer de frere Men moet niet
vergeten dat de mens gemaakt is Dat hebben we tenminste ge
leerd op school heel vroeger Tegenwoordig spreekt men melfs
van afstammeling van de aap of men spreekt over Evolutie
Met deze woorden wil ik aanduiden dat de mens nooit perfekt
is geweest en ik betwijfel het ten zeerste dat hij het coit
zal worden Een mens rnaakt per jaar zeker evenveel vergis
singen gelijk aan het geklop van ons hart Dit vermoed ik dan
Ik bekijk de wereld van vele kantens het geborenwcrden het
cpgroeien en sterven Tussen die paar kanten zit de kerk
Voor mij is eenieder hetzelfde mits hij dit van zich laat
merken dat hij als gewoon beschcuwd kan worden Er is nu cok
eenmaal afstand tussen een onderwijzer frere en leerling
Een onderwijzer zei zelf kortgeleden Je kan race ilijk ver
wachten dat een onderwijzer met alle leerlingen op school
even goede vrienden is hetzelfde komt van de kant van de
leerling
Iteze docenten proberen sons een intieme band met de leerlin
gen te onderhouden Het schijnt soms goed te gaan cp school
maar zodra de school uit is is deze band cok doorgeknipt
vervolg op bizHe gingen in een restaurant eten en ontmoetten daar een dikke
vriend van vader Dag meneer zeiden we en wilden verder
gaan om een plaats te zoeken toen hij met vader begon te
praten Wat een verrassing jullie hier te ontmoeten komen j
i jullie maar bij mij aan tafel zitten dan kunnen we heerlijk
sameii eten want ik ben net hier en heb nog geen eten besteld
Het was een cbllega van vader een zekere meneer Rondbuik Nou
die naam paste precies bij hem want hijwas heel dik en klein
en had een gezicht als een voile maan en zijn hoofd was zo j
kaalals de Sahara Er werden nog ectra borden bijgezet en
daar na werden we door een oude kelner bediend
Wat jammer zei ik tegen Danielahij is kaal en oud Maar
vader hcorde het En meteen ving ik een waarschuwende blik
van vader op alsof hij wilde zeggenPas op met wat je set
die man kan je horen Ik werd een beetje verlegen en keek
naar vaders dikke collega
Die was druk in gesprek met mijn moeder en zus Ik zag dat
zij gedwongen lachten om de grapjes die hij vertelde
Daniela schoof wat dienter naar me toe en fluisterde Zeg
als hijlaeht schudt zijnbuik op en neer en zijn ogen wor
denhet als die van een Chinees Ik kon mijn lach niet in
houden en prbestte het uit Wat hebt u toch een schik juf
frouw B zei meneer Rondbuik Ikwerd weer verlegen en glim
la chte onnozel
Na een laatste waarschuwende blik van vader gingen we eten
Ik hkm het zoutvat en strooide wat over mijn aardappelen Ik
vroeg aan meneer Rondbuik of hij ook zou wenste en ik meendeeen Ja graag gehoord te hebben zodat ik zijn aardappolen
vol zout strooide terwi jl hij met moeder over de wijn sprk
Daarna pakte hij zijn vork en mes en nadat hij met zijn tong
over zijn lippen had gestreken net alsof hij wilde zeggen
m heerlijk eindelijk kan ik beginnen pakte hij de groct
ste aardappel uit zijn bord en stak die in zijn mond Maar
toen hij die proefde begon hij te hoesten dat zijn buik er
vanschudde Er kwam geen einde aan ed de oude kelner kwam
teen gauw met een glas water aagelcpen
Och och zuchtte meneer Rondbuik Wat heb je toch gedaan
sohold hij de kelner uit Je weet toch drommels goed dat ik
geen zout mag hebben Dit is al de tweede keer dat dit ge
beurt Je zult er wel meer van horen
mmaar meneer stamelde de oude kelner uw aardappelen
hadden geen zout en die van de dames en die andere meneer ook
niet
Ik moest hem uit dit misverstand helpen dacht ik Bet was toe
allemaal mijn schuld Toen vertelde ik het hele verhaal en
was erg blij toen meneer Rondbuik alles vergeten en vergeven
had Moeder schudde veelbetekenend haar hoofd en vader die
een lach haast niet kon bedwingen stak een veel te groot stuk
biefstuk in zijn mond en verslikte zich bijna
Goddank verliep het verdere diner heel gezellig

PRAKTISCH ONEERBIEDIG
Een vijfjarig jongetje was verdwaald en terwijl hij door de
afdel ingen van het warenhuis rende glide hij Nancy Nancy
Toen zijn moeder hem vond zei ze
Je moet me niet Nancy noemenj ik ben je moederJ
Dat weet ik zei hij maar het stifct hier van de moedersvervolg van biz
Hoe voelt een leerling zich als een onderwijzer hem zegt dat
hij eeuwig en altijd over discriminatie schrijft in zijn op
stellen Je moot toch met dewereld meegaan
Wat je dagelijks meemakkt wil je ook eens vertellen aan demand
Als je eenmaal in de laatste klas van de school bent gekomen
en de leeftijd hebt bereikt dat je meer hoort verstaat ziet
begrijpt en wilt weten dan kan je niet gestopt worden
Wij leer ingen willen nu eenmaal verder komen dan we al zijn
Wie praat er nou niet over dagelijkse dingen Wei frere als
u zo tegen mijn schrijven over discriminatie bent dan ben ik
hiermee niet met u ingenomen Ik ken cnderwijzers die heel
gauw op hun teentjes getrapt zijn wie reet bent u dat ook Er
behoeft geen vriendachap tussen ons te zijn maar vijandschap
is ook niet de juiste manier om de zaak aan te pakken
Be titel hierboven past hier dan goed als er niet gesproken
en geschreven mag worden over wat je denkt
Hog een digg moeten we niet vergeten wij hebben de kans om te
zeggen en te schrijven waar ons hart vol van is want we zit
ten hier lekker demokratisch

DeiVierde KlussersL DE EERSTE KENNISMAKING MET MIJN WERK
Nadat ik op juni mijn mulodiploma had be
haald was ik van plan om verder te studeren maar gezien de
omstandigheden was ik genoodzaakt een baan te gaan zoeken
In het begin dacht ik dat het wel gemakkelijk zou gaan
i Ik had verschillende sollicitatiebreden geschreven waar ik
pas na of maanden antwoord kreeg Het ene was geen vaca
ture het andere geweigerd wegens nationaliteit Ik was ten
einde raad Het liep al tegen september twee maanden na het
examen toen ik in de krant iets las over een lo cursus
Engels Ik begon meteen de boeken die ervoor nodig waren bij
elkaar te zoeken in de verschillende boekhandels Net op de
dag dat ik bij De Wit inkomen deed kwam ik op het idee om bij
de Hollandsche Bank Unie te gaan solliciteren Ik stapte naar
binnen en vroeg aande kassier bij wie ik moest zijn om een
sollicitatieformulier te krijgen Een ogenblik zei hij
Even later werd ik binnengelaten door de secretaresse Ze
bracht me naar haar lessenaar en haalde verschillende formu
lieren voor de dag Ik natuurlijk aan het invullen van de
verschillende vragen Ze vroeg me of ik misschien diplomas
of getuigschriften bij me had Gelukkig had ik mijn punten
lijstje waarvan ik een fotocopie had gemaakt bij me dat
bedoeld was voor een sollicitatie bij de ALM Daarna moest ik
een paar sommen maken en een Engelse tekst
Er gingen bijna drie weken voorbij en ik hoorde niets
meer Ondertussen ging ik naar andere banken Twee ervan had
den me kunnen aannemen indien ik mulo met boekhouden en han
del had gedaan terwijl een andere van me eiste dat ik eerst
in het bezit moest zijn van Engelssteno nou dat was niet zo
moeilijk want daar was ik al een tijd mee bezig en zou bin
nenkort examen maken
Een maand precies toen ik al dacht dat er echt geen
werk meer voor mij te vinden was werd ik verzocht naar de
Hollandsche Bank te komen Ik kan mijn blijdschap op die dag
niet beschrijven Hst was oktober Toen had ik een
persoonlijk onderhoud met de directeur en de onderdirecteur
Jfet gigg over salaris en nog verschillende andere zaken
Be datum waarop ik moest beginnen werd vastegesteld oktobe

IfilN MORATOSH IS MIJN KLEINE MEID HETZELFDE GEBLEVEN
De eerste keer dat ik de telefoon aannam en met New
York werd verbonden kon ik mijn oren haast niet geloven
lfMet wie zegt u vroeg ik nogal onnozel Tegenwoordig ben
ik wel aan zulke telefoontjes gewend En nu heeft de tele
visie Twiggy ook ontdekt Staan me daar op een dag elf man
nen van de tv in mijn huisje Het was me een drukte en een
rommel van jewelste met al die draden en apparaten Toch had
die opname zijn goede zijde want een van onze elektrische
schakelaars was stuk en die hebben ze keurig voor me gemaakt
En nu verdient onze Lesley in twee maanden meer dan
haar vader in een jaar Ze logeert in dure hotels en rijdt
in grote Amerikaanse wagens Zelfs in mijn vakantie heb ik
nog nooit in een duur hotel overnacht en pas sinds kort heb
ben we een nieuwe auto gekocht Voor die tijd reden we altijd
in een tweedehands wagen Mijn man en ik zijn nooit verder
geweest dan Wales en waar komt Twiggy tegenwoordig niet
Tunesi Sicili Frijs New York Ze vindt het reizen
heerlijk Gelukkig maar Toch is mijn kleine meid dezelfde
gebleven Al die aandacht en dat succes hebben haar niet be
dorven Ik ben blij en dankbaar dit te mogen zeggen Of ze
nu veraf in New York werkt of vlakbij in Londen ze belt me
altijd op Ik weet precies wanneer ik haar thuis kan ver
wachten Ze weet dat vader en ik ons toch een beetje zorgen
om haar maken Daar zijn we ouders voor laten we dat maar
zeggen We hebben er nooit van gedroomd dat Lesley een top
model zou worden Wel zagen we in haar een toekonstge mode
vOntwerpster of iets dergelijks Ze heeft altijd belangstel
ling voor kleren gehad Ton mijn dochters klein waren maak
te ik bijna al hun kleren zelf Twiggy kon dan uren geboeid
staan kijken Op een dag vroeg z me een lapje stof Ze was
toen zeven Z wilde een jurk maker voor Unity haar pop Ik
hoefde haar niet te helpen ze had geen enkele aanwijzing
nodig Toen ze ongeveer elf was gebruikte ze de haaimachineVivien werkte destijds in een paksalon en zij bezorgde
haar zusje een baantje voer de zaterdag Twiggy moest het haar
van de dames wassen en verdiende daarmee een aardig eytraatje
Nu waren er eigenlijk twee kapsalons een voor dames en een
voor heren Vivien was toen nog niet getrouwd en was bevriend
met een jongeman die in de herensalon werkte Op een zaterdag
weed die jongeman s avonds door zijn broer Justin afgehaald
Justin had een sportwagentje en bood Vivien en Lesley een lift
aan Met hun vieren had ik ze even later op de koffie Die
Justinwas een rare vogel maar niet onbetrouwbaar Hij han
delde in antiek deed aan binnenhuisarchitectuur en fungeerde
soms als model voor herenmodezaken Twiggy was diep onderde
indruk
Een van haar vroegere schoolvrienden volgde een opleiding
voor fotograaf Hij had een paar prachtige fotos van haar ge
maakt die zij Justin liet zien Hij zei Als je er iets voor
voelt model te worden wil ik wel eens kijken wat ik voor je
kan doen Hij nam Lesley mee naar een bevriend fotograaf
rry Mategan Ze moest haar lange haren af laten knippen en
narry nam de fotos waarmee Twiggys triomftocht begon
Het is Justin geweest die haar de naam Twiggy heeft ge
geven Och het was eigenlijk een grap een spel Z be
schouwden mijn man en ik het Maar Justin was een pientere
vent hij zag in Twiggy een topmodel Hij is dan ook de motor
die alles op gang heeft gebracht Zonder hem was er nooit een
Twiggy geweest Jslin schreef over haar als hot model Twiggyj
en ineens wilde iedereen haar als model Ik zou werkelijk
niet kunnen zeggen of Justin en Twiggy ooit met elkaar zullen
trouwen Justin is getrouwd geweest maar gescheiden Hij en
Lesley zijn dol op elkaar maar ik geloof niet dat een huwe
lijk hu al goed voor haar is We hadden het er laatst samen
over Ze zei Ik wil nog niet trouwen in elk geval niet eer
der dan wanneer ik of ben En dat meent ze daar ben
ik zeker van
Mijn man Eorgt voor de financin Jonge mensen kennen de
waarde van het geld niet Als ze ophoudt moet er iets cp de
bank staan waarmee ze een eigen boetiek of winkel of iets
dergelijks kan beginnen laar momenteel is ze heel gelukkig
met haar leven als TWIGGY

Onze jeugd is modern en heeft veel pep Onze wereld is
locloco vol fantasin en plannen voor de toekomst
We maken feesten met beatbands er worden shows gegeven
we kdzen missteenagers van alles en nog een beetje l
Toevallig heb ik gehoord dat er vl Venezolaanse ar
tiesten naar Aruba zullen komen en dat er een GOGO teca show
wordt gehouden
Ik hou veel van dergelijke dingen Ik zou graag een
meisjesbeatband oprichten maar met meisjes die het leuk
vindrLn leuk zijn Dat zou pas fijn zijnJJ
Zoals we weten zijn er nog ouders die gehecht zijn aan
het oude Zij willen niet dat hun kinderen hun dochters op
straat lopen dat hun dochter naar een feestje gaat of met
een jongen omgaat Die meisjes mogen geen korte jurk dragen
Ik vraag me af waarom eigenlijk Ik heb geen prinses
senleven Ik draag mini wat heel gewoon Soms ga ik naar een
feest of naar een bioscoop Er zijn ouders die dat absoluut
niet willen Ze vertrouwen dan hun eigen kindren niet
Als je met een jongen op straat praat gaan ze iets
slechts van je denken
Ik ken een meisje met een moeilijk leventje Ze krijgt
bijna nooit een lief woord van haargrootmoeder Altijd
snauwt zij haar af Haar moeder zit in het buitenland dus
die ziet het meisje nooit Dan denk je toch wel eens aan vroe
ger Toen waren er niet van die dingen die nu gebeuren Maar
het staat nu eenmaal in het dikke boek geschreven

Co e cfluoTwvervolg van blz
Die maandagmorgen stapte ik vol goede moed naar het werk waar
ikop deEffectenafdeling terecht kwam
Tgen half november werd me meegedeeld dat ik begin deceim
ber ook op de seeretariaatsafdeling zou moeten zijn En zoals
het spreekwoord zegts je kunt geen twee heren dienen zo was
het ook in dit geval Ik wist bijna niets van handel noch
van boekhouden en daarom was het des te moe ilijker voor mij
om twee werken tegelijk te doen zodat ik nu sinds januari
definitief op de secretariaatsafdeling ben aangeland
Hst is hier echt prettig werken op deze afdeling En on
dertussen heb ik mijn Engelssteno behaald Begin juni van dit
jaar heb ik examen gedaan voor Engelse handel s correspondent ie
de uitslag moet nog komen
Een ding weet ik wel zeker s als je eenmaal iets wilt be
reiken moet je daarvoor je best doen en blijven doen Ik vind
het erg jammer dat ik niet door kon gaan met lo Engels
vanwege tijdgebrek Maar men is nooit te oud om te leren
En om aan een baan te komen moet men werkelijkgeduld hebben
en niet bij de pakken neer gaan zitten

Jongens jongens
onze journaalist heeft er een
verhaal van gemaakt
dat was een examen zeg Als je
gestudeerd hebt moet je voor  kunnen slagen
de overige  kan geluk zijn
Vaak zegt men dat kandidaten die de eerste dag op
gaan de beste beurt maken Maar dat kwam toch niet
uit deze keer
Als je niet gestudeerd hebt dan slaag je ook niet
Dit geldt voor de negende klassers ook D poort naar
het bittere einde staat mooi en wijd open soms wens
je er spoedig naar binnen te gaan
Misschien stond die poort wijd open en ging ieder
een er maar gewoon binnen Maar als de wolf vele
schaapjes verorberd heeft doet de herder de kooi
op een kiertje zodat het niet meer kan gebeuren
Kandidaten waarvan we het niet verwacht hadden zijn
gezakt Soms slaagt eon leerling zonder ernstig ge
studeerd te hebben Maar dat is dikwijls maar schijn
Schijn bedriegt negende klassers
Tenslotte was een schrikkeljaar Misschien ging
daarom niet alles best
Aan de geslaagden suvces verder
Aan de nietgeslaagden next time better
Een speciale felicitatie aan onze Bers die het ge
fikst hebben Ifeel wat vrije middagen heeft dat jul
lie gekost
Onze hoofdredakteur heeft het ook gehaald Hij is
bij de geslaagden opgencmen Wel FRAMIE het ziet
er naar uit dat je ons nu gaat verlaten het werk
is niet voor de poes Vergeet ons adres niet

iuxju vx Ltiiuxxi me mi om mev naai
naar Isla diOro te gaan dansen op de tonen van Hasam y su
Combo Supremo Nou daar had ik wel oren naar Ik vroeg aan
moeder of ik mocht En warempel ze vond het goed Het feest
zou om uur beginnen en om uur eindigen
On uur begon ik al te baden Mijn mooiste jurkje
trok ikaan en ik had ook een pruik gekocht Want zon haar
als ik heb kun j niet mooi omhoog kammen Ik zette mijn
pruik goed vast Die was lang zwart van kleur en heel mooi
uur was ik al klaar Daar kwamen ze me halen
Mijn vriendin met haar vriend en ook mijn vriend Ik ging
naast hem zitten en we begonnen over het feest te praten
Hij zei tegen mes Wat ben je mooi zeg Ik heb ie
nog nooit zo mooi gezien
Bij Isla di Oro stapten we uit de auto Mijn vriend
legde zijn hand om mijn schouders en zo gingen we naar binnen
We zchteheen gezellig zitje
Daar begon Hasam y su Ccsjbo Supremos te spelen We
gingen meteen aan het dansen Terwijl we over de vloer scnui
felden legde mijn vriend zijn hand op mijn hoofd En wat ge
beurde toen ik durf het haast niet te vertellen mijn
pruik viel op de dansvloer
Alle mensen begonnen te lachen En wat moest ik toen
doen Meelachen natuurlijk Dat deed ik ook Mijn vriend
schaamde zich erg Ik nam de pruik op en verdween ermee in
het toilet Daar zette ik hem weer op en probeerde hem nog
vaster te zetten
It tI ze togen mijn vriendLeg je hand er maar weer
op Ben je mal zei hij denk je dat ik hem weerwillaten
vallen
We gingen weer dansen Nu Fire in the wir Dat
ging nog heerlijker We dansten aan een stuk door tot het
feest voorbij was
Ze brachten me netjes thuis En ik ging prettig sla
pen met het feest in mijn gedachten

allemaal om te springen Sommige meisjes en jongens vragen
hun ouders toestemming om te gaan kamperen Anderen gaan op
reis en enkelen zoeken een vakantie baan Iedere leerling
houdt van vakantie Dan rustte ze uit van het hard werken op
school o Anderen willen zich misschien voorbereiden voor het
nieuwe schooljaar
Er worden ook feesten gevierd En ik heb ook een
plan voor een teenagersparty Dat zou als volgt gebeuren
eerst zal ik voor een goede beatband zorgen en voor een
club natuurlijk Dan nodig ik vrienden en vriendinnen uit
Ze meten als echte hippies konen met lange broeken en ket
tingen en al is wat te maken heeft met de moderne tijd
Dan gaan we niet cp stoelen zitten maar op de grond en in
een kring Iedere teenager is tevreden met snacks en soft
Ik hoop maar dat veel jongens en meisjes meedoen dan zal
het een echt succes worden

voor ons Afrikaanse melodieen die wat vreemd
klonken En een tafereeltje van jonge mannen
en een me is je dat langs komt dat ook hier
gebeurd kon zijn
September Krijgen we bericht dat een nieuw prinsje ge
boren is en
C Septembers mogen we daarom thuisblijven
Septembers We beginnen met een nieuwe rooster
Nou gaat alles nog beter
Bet is absoluut de moeite waard als je ooit in
Europa bent en je hebt de tijd en het geld cm naar de Scan
dinavische landen te gaan Je kunt in het winterseizoen
gaan en je hart ophalen aan skien en schaatsen je kunt
ook gaan als de meeste toeristen weg zijn in mei
In Nederland is het dan nog guur kil weer in het
noorden heerlijk zomers weer Dat kcmt natuurlijk door de
extra lange dagen s Morgens om drie uur is het licht en
s avonds cm elf uur kun je de krant nog lezen
De reis die wij maakten ongeveer km van
Amsterdam via Hamburg Kopenhagen Gotenborg Oslo het
Sonjeijord en terug naar Kristiansand en vandaar met de
boot naar Amsterdam kan ik niet vollddig beschrijven daar
om beperk ik me tot het geven van enkele bijzonderheden
Kopenhagen of Koopmanshaven de hoofdstad van
l Denemarken het Parijs van het noorden is veer de tceris
ten vooral bekend om zijn mooie bouwwerken beroemde kunst
verzamelingen schitterende plantsoenen waterpartijen en
I geweldige beeldhouwwerken Het beroemde amusementspark Ti
voli is een uitgestrekt uitspanningsoord met prachtige
bloembedden geillumineerde fonteinen en alle soorten amu
s ement
Van oud tot jeng staan de mensen zich te amuseren
aan gokautematen Je moet echt soms wel een half uur wach
ten om ook eens aan de beurt te kamen Ik vermoed dat een
Deen veel geld verdient
In Gctenburg in Zweden heb je ook zon pretpark
Liseberg iets minder groots opgezet als Tivoli Een buitengewoon mooie rit was et van Gotenburg naar Oslo langs
de diepingesneden kust westkust van Zweden daarna langs
de Oslof jord waar vest ingen en vertserkte boerderi jen nog
wijzen op de strategische positie van deze landstreek De
ligging van Oslo gezien vanaf een skischans aan deze fjord
is buitengewoon schilderachtig
Het is moeilijk de uitzichten over fjorden het
natuurschoon de hoedanigheid van de Ewegen na een lange
winter te beschrijven De Sogndalsfjcrd en de weg er naar
toe door mooie bossen afgwwisseld met een serie woeste
rotskloven was wel het toppunt van schoonheid
Van deze fjord ligging grad en NB zijn we weer
zuidwaarts gereden noordelijker waren de wegen niet berijdr
baar omdat ze deels nog bedekt waren met dooiende sneeuw j
Nee Eskimo en rendieren iglofs en ijsberen hebben we
niet gezien Teen we in Amsterdam aafekwamen was de zen weer
weg het motregende het was guur kil weer

vrijdag juli
Met vlucht van de ALM begon onze langver
wachte re is naar CuraQao Een sjieke kist die nieuwe Fokker
Bij onze aankomst gebeurde het eerste ongelukje
Een meisje verloor een van haar hakken en moest maar verder
hinken We werden direct naar onze verblijf plaats gebracht
We stelden ons een luxegebouw voor maar tot onze teleur
stelling kwamen we in een TTkippenhokTT terecht Met erg hocr
we zijn toch allemaal kippenl
We moesten ons gauw aankleden en gingen op stap
We kregen eerst Fort Nassau te zien Een fijn gerestaureerd
fort Daar heb je een prachtig uitzicht ever de geweldige
haven van Curagao Daarna reden we naar de dierentuin We
liepen daar rond terwijl we de vers chill ende dieren bekoken
De meisjes werden het meest getrokken door de apen Wei te
begrijpen he Hier hadden een paar meisjes ook geschoirmeld
anderen hadden gewipwapt weer anderen rustten even uit
Ondertussen haalde meneer ijsjes voor ons Toen meneer terug
kwam met de ijsjes wilde een zo vlug mogelijk die van haar
krijgen maar kwam in het zarud terecht In de namiddag keer
den we terug naar Brakkeput We varen natuurlijk erg honge
rig De leidsters en een groepme is jes gingen aanstonds aan
de slag an het eten klaar te maken Ondertussen vermaakten
wij ons buiten Het eten smaakte heerlijk Na het eten kre
gen we een spannende film te zien Het liep tegen elven toen
we voor deze dag eindelijk aan s la pen Ion den denken
zaterdag juli
Deze morgen hadden we een geweldige trip met deboot gemaakt door de haven Curasao is niet voor niets trots
cp zijn wateren Vandaag hebben we tevens kennis gemaakt met
Rob die bij ons de naam Mozes kreeg omdat hij een lange
baard heeft en Iheo die meteen hopeloos verliefd wordt
s Middags gingen we naar Ascension Daar werden we
door de aalmoezenier verwelkcmd We hebben er gezwommen
pingpong gespeeld rend het huis gewandeld cola gedronken
enz We verheugden ons echter op het feestje dat die avond
zou worden gehouden
rs Avonds probeerden we ens zo keurig mogelijk op te
maken zodat we te laat in het Militair Tehuis kwamen De
jongens snapten dat wel Het werd een fantastisch leuk feest
Op muzlek van e en beatband en steelband dansten we met de
TTJantjesTT van de oorlogriboot Overijssel die hier een paar
maanden geleden in de haven lag Pas laat in de avend keer
den we terug naar ons kippenhok om het feest in een drocm
voort te zetten
z on dag juli
We konden vanmorgen moeilijk opstaan en moesten toch
om half acht naar de kapel cm de HMis bij te wonen We heb
ben het wel gered hoor
Daarna zijn we naar de stad gegaan niet om inkopen
te doen maar om de winkels te bekijken Natuurlijk zochten
we vooral naar die speciaal gesorteerd zijn in artikelen vocr
damesWe liepen totdat we bij een refresqueria kwamen We za
ten daar een tijdje terwijl we een verfrissande drank kregen
legen de middag keerden we terug om onze maag te vul
len De rest van de dag hebben we in het Flamboyant Beach
Hotel doorgebracht We hebben naar hartelust gezwommen in
de zon gelegen fotcs gemaakt en veel pret gehad
fs Avcnds was het weer fijn cpmaken cm naar landhuis
Jan Kock te gaan De eigenaar leidde ons door het huis ter
wijl hij ons de bijzonderheden van dit landhuis vertelde
Het landhuis werd in de e eeuw gebouwd in verband met het
exporteren van zout naar Nederland met zeilschepen Het is
nu helemaal gerestaureerd maar daar het er donker was en
alleen maar wat kaarsen brandden ziet het er spookachtig
uit De eigenaar zei zelfs dat de werkelijke Jan Kock vaneen paar eeuwen terug daar nog leeft We hebben hem geluk
kig niet gezien We hebben ook caha di orgel gedanst maar
op onze gcgostijl Jammer genoeg werd het weer tijd am te
vertrekken
maandag juli
We waren van plan de Christcffelberg te beklimmen
maar we hadden niet genoeg energie door twee dagen heel laat
naar bed te gaan en weer vroeg op te staan We stapten maar
in de bus en reden naar Westpunt Onderweg stapten we uit
bij Boca Tabla een prachtwerk van de natuur
We reden verder naar een kiff iehuis waar we onze
boterhammen opaten en cola dronken terwijl het buiten re
gende Ook bracht de bus ons naar Coral Cliffy een bebcuwde
kust zoals hier Malmok dus met bungalows
In de namiddag maakten we een ritje met een bus
van Taber Tours Luid zingend reden we rond en gingen oa
naar het Curasao Hilton Hotel Dit is wel het mooiste hotel
van Curasao We werden daar door een dame rondgeleid Bin
nen is het hotel buitengewoon prachtig Een gunstige plek
voor wittevroodsdagenS
s Avonds hadden we barbecue We aten ons rend
Daarna hadden we film maar we vielen om van slaap Niet
allemaal hcor Na de film gingen een paar naar bed terwijl
de rest een wandeling maakte Het werd onze laatste avond
op Curasao en daaron wildenwe maar liever opblijven maar
onze gel iefde leider ideneer Hollander kwam de zaak regelen
dinsdag juli
s Morgens gingen we de stad in om inkopen te
doen Hetwas e cht f ijn Daar is het veel drukker dan hier
We kochten allemaal wat zcavel in Pbnda als in Otrobanda
s Middags werden we naar hotel Bianca gebracht
Een paar namen nog een duikje en de rest maakte zich alvast
klaar voor het diner dat er zou worden gegeven Tegen half
drie gingen we aan tafel De gerechtenwaren smakelijk Er
werd ook een speech gehouden Daarna reden we naar het
vliegveld We zouden met het vliegtuig van half vijf verI
I
trekken maar het was een extravlucht dus moesten we tot
kwart over vijf wachten fe gingen boven iets dr taken en
lie pen daar rond totdat het zover was
De terugreis was erg gezellig al wilden we niet
terug toch waren we blij weer cp cns dushi Aruba te zijn
SAAS A AAA AAVAA A
Nogmaals onze allerhartelijkste dank aan al de dames
voor hun zorg en heerlijke maaltijdenc Ook aan beide heren
We hebben werkelijk hardstikke leuke dagen gehad
In het bijzonder willen we meneer Ostendorf bedan
ken want tenslotte is hij degene die ervoor gezorgd heeft
dat deze re is mogelijk word

Hellel Hier ben ik weer Mensen wat ben ik toch een geluks
vogel soms Gisteravond hadden we onverwacht bezoek en
van huiswerk kwam niet veel terecht Ik had de hele les door
op hete kolen gezeten de zuster besloot namelijk eerst Ver
der te gaan en daarna te overhoren wat nooit is gebeurd
En heus ik had zo het gevcel dat ik een beurt zou krijgen
en de les was haast cm ik zat al van verlichting te zuchtenl
toen ikwarempel geroepen werdl Maar dank zij de goedge
luimde geesten ging de bel net Ik moest mezelf bedwingen
als het ware cm geen geluid voort te brengen dat aan een
oerwcudmens een blije zou doen denken
Op het ogenblik is iedereen naar bed en ik denk dat de hond
die naast mij ligt droomt Ze maakt rare geluiden Gcd
weet welke heer ze daar ziet
ja vandaag zijn cnze muuraanhangers geweldig geschrokken
toen plotseling een agent de rust verstoorde en hen naar
hun eigen schoolhck joeg Ik hoop dat de leeuw hen daar niet
verslonden heeft wat eigenlijk moest gebeuren
Toen ik gistermiddag uit de school kwam vond ik het hele
huis potdicht Ik heb eerst zitten denken of ik moest wach
ten cf en ik heb het gedaanJJ door het raam springen
Geweldig was het de manier waarcp ik hen verwenste de slinj
meriken waren uitgegaan en niet aan mijn bestaan gedacht
die sufferds Gelukkig ben ik niet aan de dikke kant en konj
giijn hand nog net door de hcuten shutters wringen cm de
handel naar boven te draaien Mijn poot slipte enkele malen j
en na verwoede pogingen zat ik op het kozijn Die rotjurk icklvervolg biz
My darling I love you
You surely must know
That deep down inside me
My heartache does grow
You lied when you told me
that your love was truw
You used me and hurt me
Though I still love you
While you love another
And want to be true
I pray you Ytont be hurt
as I have been by you
I would rather remember
With tears and with pain
Than not to have known your love
Though only in vain

SARADUEZc te zien een nogal veel voorkomende tit el he
Maar jammer enoeg hebben niet alle mensen die deze titel
horen dezelfde mening hierover Maar dit is wel te begrijpen
Als je zestig bent heb je niet dezelfde opinie als iemand
van of c
Als je zestig bent heb je nogal pessimistische ge
dachten hierover Dan is het direct nNou deze moderne tijd
is me ook wat God weet waar het onze jeugd allemaal naar
toe zal brengen Deze tijd brengt haast niets goods voort
Neem me die minis eens ze lopen er half naakt bij Als je
naast een meisje met zofn rok aan loopt hoef je maar een
klein beetje te bukken en je ziet het formaat van haar zit
vlak al Is dat nou de moderne tijd Wat erger is zijn de
haren van de jongens je onderscheidt ze haast niet van de
meisjes Laat het aub all een maar bij de haren blijven
Ben je daarentegen  of of beter gezegd
ben je een e chte tiener en vcel je je ook als zodanig ja
hoor dat is ook zeer belangrijk want deze twee dingen
pen niet altijd samen ben je het dus dan is je optimisme
hierover soms al te groot
Je vindt de minifs fantastisch en je zou ze graag
nog minier willen dragen dan mini
En de haren van de jongens vind je in een woord
fantastisch en onverbeterlijk
Je probeert zo psyccelic mogelijk te doen
Je lapt je broeken en hemden en loopt liever rond
als een moederloos kind want dan voel je je beter op je
gemak
Maar een ding houd je altijd vocr ogens
men mag niet te ver gaan en het cok niet te erg maken
Er zijn altijd uitersten probeer ze niet te overtreffen
want dan loopt het mis

DIE OOF i LOG E N
Het ts tosh niet nodig dat wij mensen zo gemeen zijn
tegenover elkaar Waarcm moeten we elkaar zo mishandelen
en corlogen voeren Qm alleen maar groot en machtig te
zijn Wat geeft het als je alleen maar hier op aar de groot
en machtig bent en later niet Dsnk je dat God ons daar
voor op de wereld heeft gebracht om elkaar pijn te doen
En het leven moeilijk en droevigmaken Nee toch
Duizenden kinderen verliezen hun vader in de oorlog
En als heifgrote kinderen zijn die al op eigen benen kun
nen etaan Maar soms zijn het heel kleine kinderen Wat
kunnen die arme knulletjes zonder vader in deze wereld
beginnen Niets Ze kunnen alleen maar honger lijden ver
der niets
Misschien wind je de oorlog in Vietnam helemaal niet
erg omdat je er zelf niet bij bent Maar veronderstel dat
je zelf daar was en dat je een paar dagen niets te eten
kreeg Of dat je wader moeder broers en zussen allemaal
stierven en je helemaal alleen achter lieten Zou je het
niet erg vinden Zou je niet om vrede bidden Zou je niet
zeggen Och waaran toch al die oorlogen Waaram moeten
wij mensen zc slecht zijn terwijl God zo goed woor ons is
Waaran kunnen we niet als broer en zus leven
Nu je daar niet bent weet ik zeker dat je sans je
neus optrekt voor het eten dat je moeder voor je klaar zet
Of je moppert altijd als het eten niet op tijd klaar is
Mocht dit eens een keertje bij je voorkomen zou ik je aan
raden om alleen maar event jes aan de kinderen in Vietnamte denken die misschien de rest van je eten dat je voor de
hond weggooit zouden willen opeten Ik weet zeker dat je
dan met gesloten ogen alles op zult eten of je het lust of
niet En dat je God dankbaar zult zijn dat Hij je een gezcn
de vader heeft gegeven die hard werkt om je eten te geven
Vhnd je nu zelf niet dat het tijd wordt dat er een
einde moet komen aan de oorlog in Israel enVietnam en Biafru
en overal waar nog meer oorlogen zijn
Scms vrees ik dat er een tijd zal komen dat God zijn
geduld zal verliezen Dus dat Hij spijt ervan zal krijgen
dat Hij ons ooit heeft geschapen Maar we moeten Hem dank
baar zijn dat Hij nog altijd geduld met ons heeft en dat Hij
zoveel van ons houdt
Zou je niet graag die arme kindjes willen helpen
Natuurlijk he Nu zul je vragen maar hoe kan ik ze helpen
Moet ik eten sturen Of moet ik kleren sturen Nee dat
gaat voor ons zo moeilijk
IVJaar we kunnen deze kinderen toch wel helpen als we
nu eens heel gewoon voor hen gingen bidden Bidden cm vrede
Bidden is toch ook een hulp Of niet En een heel grote ook

Hoe zal de wereld eruit zien in het
jaar In elk geval anders dan nuJ
Wie had in het jaar kunnen
voorspellen hoe het er in
uit zou zien Dat is maar jaar
vooruit zien Maar tegenwoordig gaan
de ontwikkelingen veel sneller so
anel dat er tftssen en meer
kan gebeuren dan in de eerste jaar
van onze eeuw
Op het gebied van de ruimtevaart wcrden grote dingen ver
wacht Hoogstwaarschijnlijk zullen de eerste mensen al op
Mars geland zijn Op de maan is er dan al lang een neder
zetting met een grote sterrewacht die veel meei kan ont
dekken dan eentje die op aarde is Dit konrz omdat de maan
geen dampkring heeft die het kijken door de verrekijkers
bemoe il ijkt
Nu vragen we ons af of er ook thuis iets zal veranderen
Dit zal zeker het geval zijn We zullen weer slaven krij
gen Geen menselijke slaven maar robots Ze zullen voor cb
huisvrouwen alle mogelijWe karweitjes opknappen bv tafe
dekken bedden opmaken enz Deze robctten zullen er uit
zien als dozen op pootjes met metalen armen eh handen Dat
hoeven geen twee handen te zijn misschien wel meer als t
blijkt dat dat handiger is
We zullen ook veel meer gebruik maken van de telefoon Als
je iemand opbelt zul je hem niet alleen horen maar ookzien want naast de telefoon staat een tvcntvanger Als
e de krant wilt lezen bel je het redaktiebureau op en
dan geeft je tvontvanger een beeld van dekrantenpagi
nas die je zo kunt lezen
Cp school zullenwe wel veel meer moeten leren cm al die
ingewikkelde nieuwigheden bij te houden er zullen wel leer
machines en dergelijke kcmen
Ook op het gebied van de geneeskunde zullen er veel veran
deringen optreden ziektes die we nou vrezen zullen wor
den uitgeroeid Tegenwoordig kan men al een hart overplan
ten
Maar zullen de mensen van het jaar gelukkiger zijn
dan wij Geluk is iets dat iedere mens zelf moet weten te
krijgen en dit komt niet door die robotten en dergelijke
technische nieuwigheden Wat we wel kunnen zeggen is dat
de mensen uit get jaar anders dan wij zullen leven
wanr wijleven immers niet meer zoals de Indianen En hoe
de mens sich in zofn veranderde wereld voel t hangt in de
eerste plaats van hemzelf af en niet van al die moderne
gemakken

Beste abonnees
De abonnementsgelden stromen binnen Dank u wel Maar het
aantal opstellen artikelen tekeningen viel dit keer
wat tegen De redaktie heeft daarom wel extra werk gehad
Verlichten jullie ons werk en sturen jullie gauw moge
lijk een bijdrage voor ONS tijdschrift Je kunt er deze
maand nog een prij mee winnen ook zie blz
We genieten dit jaar van een extra lange herfsfvakantie
Dat danken we aan de brugklassen Wij zijn nou ook ineens
allemaal middelhaar onderwijs geworden Je had die
mavoertjes maar eens moeten zien transpireren boven hun
gecordineerde proefwerken Welke school zou hetbeste uit
de bus komen Letten jullie ook nog op de hersengymnastiek
Komt Maria College weer in de finale We zijn benieuwd
RedaktieDe belangstelling voor onze landstaal groeit met de
dag Er is een vereniging opgericht om het papiaments te be
vorderen Al heel wat mensen vooral onderwijzers vechten
voor de invoering van deze taal op school Om te beginnen
natuurlijk op de lagere school Waarom moeten die kleine
dreumesen van amper zes jaar al in de eerste klas een vreemde
taal leren En niet alleen een paar uur per week maar het
hele programma moet in deze vreemde taal Nederlands afge
werkt worden
Je snapt dat er ook veel tegenstanders zijn voor de
invoering van het papiaments op school Zij vragen zich af
in welke klas zaul je dan met nederlands moeten beginnen En
vooral zal een leerling die pas in bv de vierde klas Neder
lands begint te leien die taal straks net zo goed kennen
als hij op de mavo komt als nu Raken we niet achter
Het papiaments zelf brengt ook nog wel problemen mee
Eerst en vooral de spelling Je zult wel gehoord of gelezen
hebben dat de regering opdracht heeft gegeven aan meneer
Rmer om die spelling vast te leggen Hij heeft al een voor
stel ingediend en er is al veel kritiek gekomen op zijn
plannen Ik vind de regels die hij gemaakt heeft ook niet
gemakkelijkj vooral omdat die spelling natuurlijk veel met
de uitspraak te maken heeftj en die uitspraak is ook niet
altijd helemaal gelijk
Straks zullen papiamentse taalgeleerden nog heel wat
meer problemen op moeten lossen Ze zullen een soort gram
matica moeten gaan maken En idioom vastleggen Wat is papia
ments voor lucifer Je weet dat ze op onze drie eilanden
daar drie verschillende woorden voor hebben We zulln ze na
tuurlijk alle drie goedkeuren Maar in andere gevallen komt
toch de vraag wel eens naar voren is dat goed of fout En
is dat mooi of lelijk papiamentsEen veel minder belangrijke vraag maar toch wel
zeer interessant is waar komt het papiamento vandaan
De laatste tijd wordt daar vrij regelmatig over geschreven
in de krant In Nederland en ook in Noord en Zuid Amerika
hebben taalgeleerden professoren daarover hun mening ge
geven
Ze zijn het niet met elkaar eens Er staan vooral
twee groepen tegenover elkaar De ene meent dat het ontstaan
is uit een soort NegroSpaans de andere zegt dat het Negro
Portugees de basis is van onze taal Elkaar overtuigen kun
nen ze niet
Ik geloof dat je als je van de taal zlf uitgaat
zoals die nu gebroken wordt je veel punten kunt opnoemen
die wijzen op NegroSpaanse afkomst Het nadeel daarbij is
dat we bijna alleen weten hoe de taal NU en de laatste
jaar gesproken wordt en werd Want het heeft heel lang ge
duurd voordat men het papianents ook ging schrijven
Bekijk je de zaak meer historisch dan lijkt mij
er veel voor te zeggen dat het NegroPortugees aan de basis
ligt van onze taal
Je begrijpt natuurlijk wel dat ons tegenwoordig
paiaments niets meer of minder waard is als we kunnen be
wijzen waar het vandaan komt
In een volgend artikel wil ik wel eens proberen te
zeggen hoe het in de geschiedenis ontstaan zou kunnen zijn
en dan snap je al dat ik ervan uit zal gaan dat Negro
Portugees de oorsprong is geweest van onze volkstaal
Dat er Afrikaans in onze taal zit meent men te kun
nen aantonen in de uitspraak en vooral in de grammaticale
structuur van het papiaments
Portugese invloed schijn je te kunnen merken aan
de uitspraak meer Portugees van Afrikaais en omdat vele
gewone woorden van waarschijnlijk van Portugese oorsprong
zijn Van de Spaanse Engelse en Nederlandse invloed kent
iedereen genoeg voorbeelden maar daarover toch een vol
gende keer meerDe Toastmasters Club Aruba organiseert weer een
jeugdzitting van de lerenigde Naties of United Nations Or j
ganisation Die vergadering vindt plaatsop zaterdagavond
november De deelnemers gaan al oefenen op november
om te zorgen dat de demonstratie zo fijn mogelijk ver
j loopt Het is niet gemakkelijk een chte vergadering zo maai
ineens te houden
De bedoeling met die ieder jaar terugkerende jeugd
zittingen is ons iets te leren over het werk en de taak
van de UNO en over de manier waarop zon echte vergadering
gehouden wordt
Daarom gaat alles als in een chte vergadering van
de UNO De twee punten die besproken worden zouden ook
echt door de Algemene Vergadering besproken kunnen worden
Alleen het aantal deelnemers is wat kleiner In de UNO zit
ten nu ongeveer landen die allemaal een afvaardiging
sturen naar New York Onze jeugdvergadering telt maar
landen die vertegenwoordigd worden door verschillende
scholen van ons eiland
Wij de vertegenwoordigers van La Salie College
zitten daar nu in als vertegenwoordigers van India We moe
ten dan proberen die punten naar voren te brengen die het
echte India zou uitspreken in de echte vergadering
Op onze zitting komen dit keer twee voorstellen aan
de orde
Frankrijk stelt voor dat geen enkel land bezit
mag nemen van andere hemellichamen waar straks geland
zal worden
Brazili stelt voor om het binnendringen van de
Cubanen in Zuid en Midden Amerika officieel te veroordelen
Alsje weet dat Frankrijk Cuba USA India Brazili
Mexico USSR Nederland Engeland Isral Egypte en Bolivia
op onze vergadering vertegenwoordigd zijn dan begrijpje
meteen dat die twee voorstellen niet zo maar aangenomen wor
den USA en USSR hebben zoveel moeite gedaan en geld uitge
geven om straks het eerste op de maan te zijn dat ze daar
ook wel iets aan willen verdienen En Cuba en de USSR zullen
zich wel verzetten tegen de veroordeling van de activiteiten
van Cuba
Dab kan heel interessant worden Zeker echt de moeite
waard om eens te komen luisteren Als je een kaartje te pak
ken kunt krijgen want er zijn maar plaatsen
We hebben het juist gehad over de ALGEMENE VERGADERING
van de UNO Dat is de vergadering waarin alle staen die lid
zijn n stem uit mogen brengen Maar die UNO kent nog heel
wat meer vergaderingen en commissies Om daar een een klein
idee van te geven hieronder de voornaamste

mee te mogen doen en ik moet zeggen het interesseerde me
ook
Woensdagavond moesten we om half negen present zijn
bij de studios van radioKelkboom om deze avond te strij
den tegen het team van het Antonius College
Voor het begon stelden we onze onderwijzer nog een
paar vragen die misschien wel zouden komen en daar werden
we al bij elkaar getrommeld door de heer Tromp Hij legde
ons de spelregels nog eens uit niemand van de toeschouwers
mag praten onder de wedstrijd Wordt er toch iets gezegd
dan wordt die vraag beloond met punten
We lootten wie er zou mogen beginnen Wij mochten
in de studio beneden beginnen Na vijftien vragen zouden
we naar beneden gaan en het Antoniuscollege kreeg dan boven
de kans
We namen met vijven plaats op de gereedstaande stoe
len een stuk van de mikrofoon af Om beurten zouden we
naar die mikrofoon moeten lopen als het onze beurt was om
de vraag te beantwoorden Wie de vraag korrekt beantwoordde
kreeg twee punten wist je het niet dan gaf je een van je
medestrijders de kans die kon dan tenminste nog n punt
voor onze school bemachtigen Dertig sekonden kreeg je
hoogstens om Het antwoord te verzinnen
In het begin wa en we allemaal vreselijk zenuwaChti
Later ging dat wat over Voor de vijfentwintig vragen zdui
den we maar even vijftig punten in de wacht kunnen slepen
en dan voor de groepsvraag nog twee extraEigenaardig als het je beurt was Je dacht helemaal
niet zenuwachtig te zijn maar als je het antwoord niet
meteen wist kwan je er nietmeer uit Je kon eenvoudig niet
nadenken en die dertig sekondenvaren ook zo kort Nee geef
mij maar een schriftelijke hersengymnastiek
Bij het zoeken naar de persona mysterioso kon je
elkaar tenminste nog helpen Je mocht dan aLleen vragen
stellen die de leider met ja of nee kon beantwoorden
En het begin daazmn is altijd gemakkelijk leeft hij nog
is het een man leeft hij op het westelijk halfrond enz
Dat hadden we samen goed afgesproken In de kortst mogelijke
tijd hadden we die gevonden
En we wonnen zelfs de wedstrijd maar je moet niet
vragen hoe We behaalden dertien hele punten De tegenpartij
maar elf Een schrale troost Als we in de tweede wedstrijd
niet ontzettend veel punten halen kunnen we het voor dit
jaar weer vergeten want de vier scholen die voor de twee
wedstrijden samen de meeste punten halen komen bij de fina
listen
Twee jaar geleden sleepten we de beker in de wacht
Vorig jaar vielen we net buiten de prijzen Dit keer
ULAPOp mei begon mijn leven Ik was kleiner dan het
zaadje van eenappel maar ik was nu al mijzelf Hoe onge
vormd ik op dat ogenblik ook was ik zou toch een meisje
worden Mijn haren en ogen zouden gitzwart worden
Moeder deed zo ongeveer alles voor me En het gekke
was dat ze zelf nog steeds niet wist dat ze me droeg recht
onder haar hart Pas op mei vertelde de dokter aan moe
der dat ik in haar leefde Zij was natuurlijk erg blij
Welke moeder zou niet blij zijn als ze dit hoorde
Mijn vader en moeder wisten nog niet dat ik een meis
je was Misschien verwachtten ze wel een jongen of een
tweeling Maar ik zou hen verrassen En ik wilde heten
net als mijn grootmama Mijn mond begon zich nu te ontwik
kelen Denk je eens in over een jaartje zou ik lachen en
later zou ik kunnen praten Ik wist wat mijn eerste woord
zou zijn mammie
Mijn gezichtje had zich nu helemaal gevormd Ik hoop
te dat ik op moeder zou lijken jammer genoeg was het
juist anders Nu was ik zowat in staat om te zien maar
het was nog steeds donker om me heen Mijn ogen zouden
zich spoedig openen in een wereld van zonneschijn bloe
men en kinderen Nooit had ikde zee gezien of een berg en
ook geen regenboog Hoe zouden die er uitzien
Iedere dag groeide ik een stukje Mijn armen en benen
begonnen vorm te krijgen Maar ik zou nog lang moeten
wachten voor mijn beentjes me hardlopend naar moeders ar
men zouden dragen en voordat mijn armen vader konden om
helzen Mijn hart begon vandaag helemaal zelfstandig te
kloppen Van nu af aan zou het mijn hele leven lang zacht
jes blijven slaan Dan na vele jaren zal het moe worden
en stilstaan
Maar ik stond niet aan het einde maar aan het begin

Dicen mis amigos que no eres para mi

We hebben het zo druk en de tijd gaat zo snel dat
de grote en kleine gebeurtenissen op school eenvoudig niet
opgetekend kunnen worden
De vierde klassen gingen weer van cultuur genieten
Het viel op een zondag dit keer Maar de opkomst was toch
gped Geen wonder ook Een toneelgroep uit Curacao bracht
een prachtig stuk op de planken in het papiaments
Een van de borden is al drie jaar defect Nou zal er
toch eens iets aan moeten gebeuren Een van de heren ver
ongelukte er bijna mee
We hebben weer de helpende hand uitgestoken Vele
meisjes stelden zich beschikbaar om kerstkaarten van de
Unicef te verkopen Drie gulden per doos mooie kaarten
en voor een goed doel
Wat herfst is weten we niet uit ervaring We mogen
nou wel ervaren wat een herfstvakantie is Bijna een volle
week als weekend Een ongekende weelde Wat zullen we ge

ware Pyrrhusoverwinning We schaamden ons verschrikke
lijk dat we zo weinig punten haalden Wie noemt nou ook
als zonen van No Set Cham en JahweEn van de
drie goed leverde geen punten op Alleen de groepsvraag
losten onze jongens razendsnel op Vernuftig
Onze vierde klassers lachten zich een kriek toen
ze in het Cultureel Centrum Mentira na granel bekeken
Een vlot stuk in onze eigen cultuurtaal
De eerste klassers of brugklassers hadden enkele
moeilijke dagen Geen centrale proefwerken nee gecor
dineerde proefwerken Voor Engels Spaans Nederlands en
wiskunde En met zon rust ondergingen ze dat alles Er
was weinig van te merken En dat voor wiskundeopgaven
die ze zelfs in de vierde klas niet eens kunnen maken
Vraag daar maar eens naar de doorsnede van twee verzame
lingen Vooral als er dan een lege verzameling uitkomt
dan weten ze helemaal niet waar ze het hebben

It was a hot sunny day
ln the middle of the nightL
The streets were crowded
ffl And not a soul was in sighti
The rain was snowing fast
And a burntout candle was shining dark
It was a hot sunny day
In the middle of the night
When two dead bodies began to fig
Back to back they faced each other
Drew their swords to shoot each other
A paralyzed dontey came running by
And kicked one of them in his le ft rij
A de af policeman heard the wail
And a blind police took them both to ja
Where he locked them up in an open celle
They sat afc the corner of a round table
While outside the window inside

Ml dtf TNrS faioroena PtrocchiEr is hier op school een leuk geel karretje Als het
start draait iedereen zijn hoofd om Enkele leraren dach
ten in het begin Wie is die brutale kerel die met een
brommer onze speelplaats op durft te rijden
Maar het is het gele karretje van meneer Osten
dorf
Ben je in de Nassaustraat en je hoort iemand met
ontvettend veel lawaai aan komen sputteren denk dan maar
aan een geel karretje
Zit je in Mie Habibe en je hoort in de verte een
oude motor dan hoef je niet eens naar buiten te gaan om te
kijken want je weet al wie het is
Kwart voor acht zien alle meisjes met schrik hoe het
gele karretje om de hoek van onze school stuiftj alweer
haast De twee kinderen houden zich stevig vast aan de zit
plaats bij elke draai die het gele karretje neemt
Tuuuuuut wie is die kerel die zon kabaal madet
Het is en blijft het gele karretje dat vreer haast heeft
Laatst zaten we in de klas toen we een vreselijk
lawaai hoorden Mevrouw LopezHenriquez zei rustig Zeg
hebben jullie nooit een brommer heren starten We schoten
allemaal in onze lach en zeiden dat het de aito van meneer
Ostendorf was
Zullen we eens een collecte houden om wat olie voor
dat karretje te kopen

Na de ontdekking n verovering van Amerika brachten
de Spanjaarden in die gebieden hun Spaai se kultuur en Spaan
se taal Ze deden dat cmdat ze ervan overtuigd waren dat
hun beschaving ver stond boven die van de Indianen die ze
aantroffen maar misschien ook wel cmdat het een oribegonnen
werk was alle indianentalen te gaan lerenc Er werden veel
meer dan honderd verschillende talen gesproken in Zuid en
Midden Amerka Zo hebben ook de bewoners van onze Antillen
Spaans geleerd Hoeveel er van hun indianentaal overgeble
ven is We weten het niete Maar bijna zeker zeer vele namen
van bergen kusten en landstrekene
Toen de Nederlanders in dienst van de Westndische
Compagnie Curacao veroverden in werden de enkele
Spanjaarden die er waren sanen raet het oevrgrote deel van
de indiaosn van het eiland afgezet Die indianen waren immers
bevriend met de Spanjaarden en konden straks wel eens hel
pen om deze eilanden te heroveren
Het aantal bewoners van Curacao moet toen voorlopig
erg klein geweest zijn Een kleine groep indianen en een
groetere groep europeanen die in dienst waren van de WICe
De taal van de WIC was officieel Nederlands maar zij
had zoveel huurlingen n dienst oea de soldaten die
geen Nederlands verstonden zodat deze mensen zich wel heb
ben moeten behelpen met een mengelmoesje van talenc
Na begint de WIC zich druk bezig te houden
met de slavenhandel Curacao wordt er een centrum van en
ieed dienst als slavendepot Van hieruit werden de markten
van Venezuela en Colombia voorzien Een deel van die slaven
bleef op Caracao oea om op de plantages te werken
De grote vraag is nu welke taal hebben deze mensen
uit Afrika gesprokenc Ze kwamen uit verschillende streken
van Afrika Ze spraken zeer zeker verschillende Afrikaanse
talen van huis uit en konden elkaar ziet zo maar verstaan
Het zal dan ook wel een mengelmoestaaltje geweest zijn
Op de kusten van Guinea in Afrika werden ze inge
scheept Die kusten waren Portugees En de Portugezen hadden
een AfrikaansPortugees of GuineesPortugees taaltje ont
wikkeld dat dienst deed als de internationale verkeerstaal
Hoe lang hebben die slaven daar aan de kust moeten wachten
op inscheping Dat kan voor sommigen vrij lang geweest zijn
want de verbindngen verliepen niet volgens een timetable
Ze kunnen daar dus kennis gemaakt hebben met die internati
onale taal en die gedeeltelijk geleerd hebben en daardoor
elkaar hebben leren verstaan
Hebben die mensen onderw ook in die taal met elkaar
gepraat Of is hen weinig kans gegeven om te praten onder
weg Dat zij onderweg een eigen taal hebben ontwikkeld is
onwaarschjnlijk Voor zover deze slaven doorverkocht zijn
aan Zuid Araerika hebben ze daar vlug genoeg het Spaans als
voertaaL leren gebruiken Maar de slaven op Curacao
Vanaf zijn er heel wat Portugese Joden uit Bra
zilie op Curacao komen wonen In de handel kregen ze voor
lopig geen kans van de Nederlandersj daarom vestigden zij
zich daar vooral als plantagehouder Zij zulien aan de Bra
ziliaanse kusten zeker kennis gemaakt hebben met de boven
genoemde internationale verkeerstaal en konden zich nu in
die taal verstaanbaar maken bij hun slaven Daarnaast zullen
ze ook hun best gedaan hebben de officiele Nederlandse taal
te lerenj maar dat zal aardig wat moeite gekost hebben
Langzaamaan is dit Papiamento de omgangstaal geworden voor
Curacao
Maar dan is het zeker al geen zuiver Afrikaass
Portugees meer Over de invloed van het Spaans de volgende
keerOndeelbare getallen of priemgetallen
zijn getallen die alleen maar door en door zichzelf te
delen zijn
Dat een priemgetal is weet iedereen
Maar is bv een priemgetal
Twee jongens uit c van het LSC haddeh de moed dit
te onderzoeken en beweerden dat inderdaad een priem
getal zou zijn Er was zelfs een prijsje aai verbonden
Bij het verifieren zijn we zo te werk gegaan
Hett kwadraat dat just boven ligt is namelijk
het kwadraat van
Nu zijn er priemgetallen onder de namelijk
I
II
Dus je gaat even door elk van deze getallen
delen behaLve door Inatuurlijk en als dan geen van deze
delingen een rest oplevert is een priemgetal
Toen waren we zo slim er teamwerk van te maken elke
jongen deelde door en van die getallen Niemand vond als
rest zodat we nu wisten dat een priemgetal is
De kritische lezer zal misschien zeggens Wat is het
nut hiervan Wat heb je er aan
Een antwoord zo maar voor de grap een uitdagende
nieuwsgierigheid En ook een eenvoudig voorbeeldje wat je
met teamwork kunt doen

Dan laat ik jou
Tot al mijn spijt
Is het verloren tijd
Ik laat je vrij
Maar kom dan niet meer bij mij
BettyDe derde juli was het min of meer zo ver dat ik wist
dat ik naar Aruba moKht Ik stond voor ons huis met Chin te
priten toen de postbode mij een stapel brieven overhandide
Ik keek vlug of er geen brieven voor mij bij waren En waar
empel twee brevenj en van mijn ma en een van de KLM
Ik zei tegen Chin Ik denk dat ik naar Aruba mag
Ik madcte die brief van mijn moeder openj ze schreef
dat ze daar op Aruba geboekt had voor me en ik moest de da
tum vaststellen waarop ik naar Aruba wilde vertrekken Ik
nam meteen kontakt op met de KLM en de juli kon ik
gaan
Die morgen stond ik vroeg op Chin bracht mij met mijn
brommer naar het station vanwaar ik met de KLMbus uit
Den Bosch vertrok Om ongeveer uur waren we op Schiphol
Ik moest nog twee uur wachten Elke minuut leek een eeuw te
zijn Eindelijk hoorde ik een lief stemmetje omroepen Pas
sagiers voor vlucht met bestemming Curacao worden ver
zocht zich naar pier D te begeven
Om twaalf uur waren wij in de lucht e vlogen boven
Nederland mt bestemming Frankfurt onze eerste tussenlan
ding Daarna Lissabon onze laatste landing in Europa Daar
in Portugal maten we weer kennis met de tropische hitte
C gewoon om er dood van te gaanOra half vijf s raiddags stegen we op met als reisdoel Para
maribo Caracas Curacao Om half acht Surinaarase tijd
landden we op vliegveld Zanderij Het regende pijpestelen
Zoals u al merkt van het ene regemland in het andere
Kwart over acht vertrokken wij naar Caracas en daar om
naar HatoCuracao Om uur ongeveer maakten wij onze laat
ste landing na een vermoeiende dag
We moesten de nacht op Curacao doorbrengen Ik nam
een taxi naar Hotel Inetrcontire ntal en vroeg de chauffeur
mij daar de volgende morgen om half zeven te komen halen
Buiten was het snikheet Gelukkig in het hotel niet zodat
ik in de airco heerlijk kon slapen De volgende raurgen stond
de chauffeur op me te wachten Om half acht vlogen we boven
de helderblfiuwe Caribische Zee En even later lag daar het
eiland Aruba met zijn witte palmenstranden
Mijn moeder broers en zusters stnden me al op te
wachten We reden naar de stad Thuisgekomen was het eerste
wat ik deed onder de douche kruipen oraaf te koelen
Ik moest mijn zusjes alles over Nederland vertellen
Later besloot ik samen met mijn grote broer de stad te gaan
verkennen Er is veel veranderd in die twee jaren De Nas
saustraat kreeg een paar nieuwe gebouwen bij die uit ar
chitectnisch oogpunt niks bijzonders zijn Die beunhazen
daar op Aruba hebben geen artistieke aanleg en bouwen alles
in dezelfde kubusachtige vorm Maar ik moet ook zeggen dat
bij Malmok een heleboel mooie prachtige bungalows zijn ge
zet
Ik dwaal weer af Om kwart over elf besloot ik een
kijkje te gaan nemen op het La Salle College waarvan ik
eodleerling ben Ik had niet zoveel tijd daar ik om half
twaalf een afspraak had Ik ging eerst naar fr Arnold die
net bezig was een moeilijk planimetrisch probleem op te
lossen Ik klopte en ging de klas binnen De frre zei Effe
wachten jou ken ik even zien o ja natuurlijk jij bent
Mito Martis Ik stond verbaasd dat hij mij zomaar herkendej
mijn broers konden dat niet eens

Na eventjes gebabbeld te hebben ging ik fr Arnulfus
opzoeken Die was bezig les te geveen aan de nieuwe aan
vullende Bers Toen moest ik weer vertrekken Het was on
dertussen al half twaalf geweest dus moest ik me haasten
om de afspraak niet te missen Aan de andere leraren bied
ik mijn verontschuldigingen aan dat ik ze niet even per
soonlijk heb gegroetj ik belooi dat het volgend jaar wel te
doen tenminste als ik overgaj anders mag ik niet naar
Aruba
ja meneer Zonjee heb ik ook ontmoet Maar dat was
bij Basi Ruti Ik liep daar op het strand en zag iemand ver
boven de anderen utstekenj toen wist ik al das die heer
uit Castricum Hij genoot zeker van ons strand hier in
Nederland hebben ze er geen dat aan het onze kan tippenj
ook niet Scheveningenj ik ben een beetje chauvinistisch
maar dat mag toch h
Even slijmenj in Castricum hebben ze iets dat wij
niet hebbenj behalve klei hebben ze ook prachtige bloemen
allerlei kleuren en soorten het is wel de moeite waard
Castricum eens te bezoeken
Ik dwaal weer af dat mag niet Later heb ik maieer
Zonjee ontmoet bij de bar van Basi Ruti hij zat aan een
cocktail nee geen Balashicocktail deze was gekleurd
Na een paar dagen ontmoette ik weer mijn vrienden
ze herkenden mijnniet meer
Mijn vakantie daar op Aruba was heerlijk feesten
barbecueparties harkyparkies enz enz
ja op tienergebied is Aruba ook vooruit gegaan
er zijn nu discotheques wel een beetje aan de krappe
kant een een beetje expensive voor arme scholieren
De meisjes dragen minirokjes soms korter dan hier mn Ne
derland toen ik twee jaar geleden naar Nederland ging was
daar nog geen sprake van De meisjes lijken me nou wel wat
vrijer maar toch zijn de ouwelui nog aan de strenge kantBeatbands voor een klein eiland als Aruba zijn er veel
maar weinige zijn goed en de beste die kunnen niet tippen
aande slechtste hier in Nederland Dus bandleiders haal
het nooit in jullie kop om met een band hier te komen daar
jullie van HONGER zullen vergaan Neem bijvoorbeeld Three
Voices volgens velen de beste band in de Antillen een
grote vergissingvolgens mij is TM beter dan zij Die ziji
hier geweest en ze maakten niks klaar
De jongens van Aruba vind ik moeten zich iets hipper
gaan kleden iets in de geest van de hippe vogels
In mijn vakantie daar op Aruba heb ik ook vakantiewerk
gedaan k solliciteerde bij een aannemersbedrijf en moest
bouw en waterbouwkundige werkzaamheden verrichten bij de
EEGbrug Balashi Het was leuk werk ik heb veel kunnen
leren
Intussen werd mij geen studiebeurd toegekend en later
weer wel Op augustus moest ik weer naar Nederland ver
trekken Naarmate de vertrekdatum naderde werd ik droeviger
De laatse vier weken daar op Aruba werd mijn hart getrans
planteerd
Ik ben nu studentnaan de HTS Den Bosch afdeling
bouwkundej ik zit in het voorbereidend jaar In tien maan
den tijd moeten we de stof ingehaald hebben van de jari
ge hbsB Het wordt een moeilijk jaar voor mij en waar
schijnlijk niet minder voor jullie MAVOers MULOers
Ik wens jullie allen veel succes en tot ziens in
juli op Aruba

Om weg te wissen alle domme rassenstrijd

Een Schot laat zich in een zaak muizenvallen tonen maar
kan niet beslissen welke hij zal nemen
De verkoper prijst zijn waren aan Deze muizevallen werken
allemaal onberispelijk en zijn niet duur
Dat kan wel zijn maar denkt u eens aan de onkosten die
het met zich meebrengt Ik ben eigenlijk op zoek naar een
systeem waarbij de muis wordt gedood voor hij de kans
krijgt het spek op te eten
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooo oooooooooooooooooooo
Mammie word ik mooi als ik groot bn Misschien Ik weet
het niet Nou als ik niet mooi word hoop ik dat k er
net zo uitzie Sls uGeachte jongens en meisjes
Na lange tijd niets ingestuurd te hebben ben ik er weer
met een artikel Ik hoop dat het in de smaak zal vallen
Dit is de zesde jaargang van Bao di Kwihij en ik ben rm
ookzes jaar abonnee Altijd bewaar ik de BdK zodat ik al
veel nummers van het tijdschrift heb De eerste tien heb
ik laren inbinden en die heb ilc nu voorme
De eerste redaktie van BdK bestond uitt LMacalonie hoofd
redakteur verder ELasten RBlume PZaandam SEmerencii
HOduber EHerd en WPiternella Volgens mij was dit eer
ste jaar het beste van allemaal Als iemand iets in wilde
sturen dan moest het zelf geschreven zijn gefantaseerd
Maar het mocht niet overgeschreven zijn uit een ander boek
of tijdschrift Dat vond iedereen leuk dan lees je altijd
iets wat je nog nooit gelezenhebt
Ik heb toen ook een stukje ingestuurd De redaktie dacht
dst het overgeschreven was en publiceerde het niet De re
daktieleden waren toen zeer streng Er werd toen ook veel
meer over sport geschreven Nu hoor je niets meer over
sport En na elke culturele voorstelling werd een inter
view gepubliceerd EHerd zorgde toen voor dat interview
met de artisten Dat missen we ook in deze zesde jaargang
Sr stond toen ook een vervolgverhaal in dat heette Chemu
en Chebu dos genios Maar jammer genoeg werd al in het
zesde nummer van die eerste jaargang aangekondigdWegens
een ernstige treinramp kunnen onze beroemdheden Chemu en
Chebu hun vervolgverhaal voorlopig niet voortzetten Na t
ongeluk werden ze in het San Pedro Hospitaal opgenomenVoor hun leven wordt gevreesd Maar nu horen we na jaar
nog niets van hen
Er was toen ook een Missieaktie geld sparen om de
studiekosten van een seminarist te betalen En zo blader
je verder Ik lees nu nog die BdKs met veel genoegen Het
was zeker een teste tijd Het mooiste artikel dat ooit ge
publiceerd is vond ik in nurnmer van de eerste jaargang

had bijna een hekel aan hem Een gek kaa meer vragen dan
tien wijzen kunnen beantwoordenDe leraar vertrouwde
hem maar half en vroeg hem nog een spreekvroord Wie de
schoen past trekke hem aan De onderwijzer vjerd booss
Een ander spreekwoord of ik stap naar de direkteur
Wim trok zich daar niets van aan en zei Veel geschreeuw
maar weinig wol Woedend verliet de leraar het lokaal
Als de kat van honk is dansen de muizen op tafel glun
derde VJim Even later kwam de taalman kalm en waardig ach
ter de direkteur de klas weer ins Het hinkende paard komt
achteraan mompelde Wim Zo Wimpie wil jij mij ook eens
een spreekwiaord laten horen Een ongeluk komt zelden
alleen was het vlotte antwoord Verder kwam hij niet
Hij werd de bank uitgesleurd Bezint eer gij begint hikte
hij nog en toen dat niet hielp en de direkteur hem met een
pak slaag dreigde riep hij uit Wat gij niet wilt dat u
geschiedt doe dat ook een ander niet
Wim werd naar huis gestuurd maar bij de deur had hij zijn
schrik toch wel overwonnen Oost west thuis best En de
poort sloeg achter hem dicht

Beter laat dan nooit Met schaamrode kaken brengen we u dit
laatste nummer van vorig jaar We hadden een heleboel kerst
tekeningen klaar Maar we kunnen nou geen kerstnummer meer
brengen Waarom we zo laat zijn
Eerst en vooral hadden we geen kaften meer Om met onze ad
verteerders in overeenstemming te komen viel niet mee en
zo kon de drukker niet optijd klaar komen
Onder de vakantie was het studeren geblazen voor de tiende
klassers van LSC wat die hadden in het begin van het jaar
tentamen Nu zijn de meisjes pp o taan aan het spelen zij
hebben volgende week tentamen
Maar mogen we u toch nog wel allen abonnees medewerkers
en adverteerders een voorspoedig toewensen Het aller
beste in het pas begonnen jaar
Redactie
We schreven de vorige keer nog dat het AfrikaansPor
tugees niet zuiver was gebleven Er is al spoedig contact
metde Spaai se taal
Op de eerste plaats waren er indianen achter gebleven
op Curacao Hun aanbal was gering Hun invloed misschien
ook maar zij kenden voorlopig niets anders dan Spaans
Toen kwanen de Spaans sprekende missionarissen die
vroeger de indianen al bekeerd hadden en nu hun beste
krachten kwamen geven aan de slaven voor zover zij daar
voor toestemming konden krijgen en aan de blanken voor
zover deze al katholiek waren Zij kwamen erg regelmatig
vanaf het einde van de zeventiende eeuw
Dan waren er de verschillende echtgenoten Vele ar
mere blanke kolonisten zochten een bruid in Venezuela En
de vrijen die het zich konden permitteren deden hetzelfde
De rijkere blanken gingen meestal op huwelijksreis naar
Nederland
Ook moeten er Venezolaanse en Colombiaanse immigran
ten gekomen zijn Curacao was arm maar kende toch af en
toe een kleine opleving en dat trok anderen aan
Tenslotte had ook Curacao een geregelde handel op
de kusten van Zuid Amerika gekregen
De Spaanse taal werd daarom door velen gesproken en
het Papiamento was toen zeker nog niet sterk genoeg om
deze invloed te werenPI

Nu ging het allemaal nog over het papiamento op Cu
racao En op Aruba dan
Het aantal ambtenaren van de Westindische Compagnie
dat op Aruba gestationeerd was was rg gering in de eerste
honderd jaar Een commandeur en twee tot vijftien soldaten
was de hele bezetting De indianen ook niet talrijk zul
len hun eigen taal of Spaans gesproken hebben Spaans om
dat we mogen aannemen dat zij door de Spaase missionarissen
bekeerd die taal hebben leren kennen
De Westindische Compagnie had op Curaeao ervaren dat
de grond die eigenlijk haar eigendom was en die ze ook
eigenlijk niet wilden verkopen je kon nooit weten toch
in handen van particulieren was gekomen Om dat op Aimba
niet te laten gebeuren verbood de WIC naar Aruba te emi
greren De eerste uitzondering werd gemaakt in B Mozes
Maduro vertrok toen naar ons eiland al heel spoedig ge
volgd door andere families De opzet zal geweest zijn hier
plantages te beginnen maar dat moet wel tegengevallen zijn
Voor ons artikel is voornaam dat alleen families die
al jarenlang op Curaeao gewoond hadden toestemming kregen
naar Aruba te gaan Als we dan mogen aannemen dat het Papia
mento de omgangstaal was geworden in op Curaeao dan
is het gemakkelijk te verklaren hoe het Papiamento op Aruba
is gekomen De bevolking de indianen van hier heeft de
taal van deze grote heren grotendeels of geheel overge
nomen in de loop der jaren Van de andere kant is het ook
begrijpelijk dat het Arubaanse Papiaments lange jaren en
misschien nog wel spaanser was dan dat van ons zuster
eiland
Op gelijke wijze lijkt mij ik weet dat niet precies
zal het Papiamento naar Bonaire gegaan zijn Bovendien zijn
er op Bonaire meer slaven geweest dan op Aruba en dat kan
ook meegeholpen hebben onze taal daar te brengen
In deze drie artikelen heb ik geprobeerd te verkla
ren hoe het Papiamento historisch gezien ontstaan kan
zijn en zich ontwikkeld kan hebben Er blijven veel Vraag
tekens Met meer aandacht voor dit cultuurgoed zullen toch
nog heel wat vraagtekens opgelost kunnen Tierden fPEEn JRCHT VOR

O houdt terug elk haastig woord
dat aan u dreigt te ontglippen
Jij weet niet hoe het smarten kan
al zwijgen straks uw lippen
De wonde die uw hand eens sloeg
kan helen en verouden
Maar t wondend woord sterft niet
sterft nooit maar blijft zijn kracht behouden
houdt terug elk haastig woord
dat aan u wil ontglippen
De sporen wist gij nimmer uit
al zwijgen lang uw lippen
Telkens als je blij bent
Telkens als je lacht
Wordt mijn hart wat sterker
Met liefde en met krachteens vloog onze bal een verkeerde richting uit dwars de
weg over In de spanning van het spel holde mijn vriendje
Fred er achteraan zonder naar links of naar rechts te kij
ken We schreeuwden als gekken daar kwam in volle vaart
de wagen aan gerend Wij durfden er niet naar toe lopen zo
waren we geschrokken Een paar mannen droegen Fred al weg
van de straat en legden hem neer op ons veldje Doodstil
stonden we er omheen Bleek en onbeweeglijk lag hij voor
ons uiterlijk ongedeerd Maar een toevallig langskomende
dokter zei Niets meer aan te doen Hij is dood Pas la
ter hoorden we dat Fred door een ijzeren stang onder tegen
zijn nek werd geraakt en door een schedelbasisbreuk op slag
dood was
Toen ik was nog jong was het woord dood voor mijiets volkomen onbegrijpelijks Fred zou nooitmeer pstaan
on naai zijn moeder kunnen hollen Een paar minuten geleden
had hij nog met oris gespeeld en met al zijn vurigheid een
doelpunt gemaakt Ik snapte er niets van
Nu ben ik een jaar of tien ouder Een paar weken ge
leden stond ik aan de wieg van mijn eerste neef JanWillem
Mijn zus die vorig jaar getrouwd is had haar eerste kindje
gekregen n ik was voor deeerste keer oom geworden Negen
maanden lang had zij het levende geheim onder haar hart ge
dragen en wij allen om haar heen voelden de grootheid van
dit wonder iedere dag groeien De beide toekomstige omas
waren weken in de weer mt het breien van truitjes en broek
jes en met het merken van een onoverzienbare stapel luiers
Kort voor de geboorte kwam er een wiegje in huis En toen
toen wrd ik op een morgen opgebeld door vader die met
trots in zijn stem door de telefoon zemJe spreekt met
grtteader
Diezelfde middag stond ik aan het wiegje En wr
snapte ik iets niet Een klein hoopje mens nauwelijks achu
pond zwaar dat niets anders dd dan slapen schreeuwen en
drinken En toch een mens Zijn vingers waren kleine gar
naaltjes en toch hoefden ze niets anders te doen dan te
groeien om een vuist te worden zoals waarmee jij en ik bij
onze kameraden erop los timmeren als we een keer knok heb
ben Zijn hoofd was wat groter dan een tennisbal en toch
hoefde er niets meer bij helemaal vanzelf zal het groter
en sterker worden zodat hij er zware voetballen mee kan
wegkoppen en met zijnnhersens een rot meetkundeproefwerk
kan maken op school Zijn benen waren niet veel meer dan
twee gekookte worstjes en toch gaat het allemaal vanzelf
oVer een jaar sjouwt hij ermee door de kamer en als hij
net zo oud is als jij en ik racet hij ermee op de fiets
naar school en springt hij misschien wel verder dan wij
samen
Ged beschouwd snap je daar allemaal niets van En
toch zijn wij allemaal z begonnen te leven Als een celle
tje van nog geen duizendste millimeter groot in de schoot
van onze moeder Heus nog geen duizendste millimeter
Moet je nu eens zieni Nu ben je misschien de sterkste van
de klas of de beste sprinter of een goed zwemmer Je bent
aan het groeien op een ontzaglijke manier en klaagt jouw
moeder ook niet telkens steen en been dat je alweer uit
een broek of jas bent gegroeid En dat gaat allemaal van
zelf Je hoeft er eigenlijk nooit aan te denken het gaat
zo maar Dat is nu het mysterie van het leven Het begint
en eindigt en het groeit en het sterft op een manier waar
wij niets van snappen Het is iets heel groots wat wij
eigenlijk niet onder woorden kunnen brengen

Slechts nmaal heb ik u gezien Gij waart
Gezeten in een sneltrein die de trin
Waar ik mee reed passeerde in volle vaart
De kennismaking kon niet korter zijn
En toch zij duurde lang genoeg om mij
Het eindloos levenspad met fletse lach
Te doen vervolgen Ach geen enkel blij
Glimlachje liet ik meer sinds ik u zag
Waarom ook hebt gij van dat blonde haar
Daar de englen aan t kennen zijn En dan
Waarom blauwe ogen wonderdiep en klaar
Gij wist toch dat ik daar niet tegen kan
En waarom mij dan zo voorbijgesneld
En niet als t weerlicht t rijtuig opgerukt
En om mijnhals uw armen vastgekneld
En op mijn mond uw lippen vastgedrukt
Gij vreesde mooglijk voor een spoorwegramp
Maar Rika wat kon zaalger voor mij zijn
Dan onder hels gerdel en gestamp
Met u verplet te worden door n trein

Ik hoorde het gelach der kindren
Het gezang der vogels
Het gesoebat van mensen om hulp om me heen
Een wereld vol vreugd en verdriet
Maar zag niets van dat alles dan
Mijn verloren geluk dat mij verblindde
Ogen zo blauw als de hemel
Haren zo zwart als de nacht
Een gezicht zo helder als de zon
Met een glimlach die mij altijd verwarmde
Een lichaam zo teer als dat van een kind
Zo zag het eruit MIJN GELUK
Eenzaam en vermoeid
Met blaren onder mijn voeten
Zout op mijn lippen
Wind in mijn haren
Zo liep ik de wijde wereld in
Zoekend en strijdend
Naar mijn verloren geluk
Och help me dan toch
Ik kan niet meer
Ik zou willen gillen om hulp
Waar is het gebleven
Waar kan ik het vinden
MIJN VERLOREN GELUK
Waar in s hemelsnaam dan toch
Als het zelfs daar niet meer is
Nee nooit zou en zal ik het vinden MIJN GELUK
Want ja ik besef het DE DOOD
Die was het die ik niet kon overwinnen p c

Vanaf het vliegveld Daressalam OostAfrika stijgt
een grote machine p volgeboekt met mensen richting de
Kaap
De machine is nog geen kwartier in de lucht als de
eerste piloot plotseling iets kouds en vochtigs voelt glij
den om zijn hals H idioot Ga me niet zo stom zitten
pesten gromt hij er vast van overtuigd dat achter hem
zijn radiotelegrafist weer een van zijn grappen aan het
uithalen is Van de bemanning besteedt geen mens enige aan
dacht aan zijn woorden er zit niemand achter hem en ze ver
staan hem ternauwernood door de microfoon
Enkele ogenblikken later voelt John zijn hart in zijn
lijf omdraaien vlak voor zijn ogen glijdt langzaam de kop
van een salng met trillende tong van zijn schouder af Een
mamba een van de gevaarlijkste slangen van ZuidAfrika
John weet dat en hij weet ook dat de kleinste beet van het
reptiel in enkele seconden zijn dood ten gevolge zal hebben
n de dood van de mensen die hem zijn toevertrouwd
Langzaam rolt de slang verder rond de hals van John
En hij kan zich niet omdraaien of om hulp roepen In n
seconde zou de mamba hem bijten
Wat een geluk dat het weer zo kalm is om te vliegen
schiet hem door zijn hoofd Geen windstoten geen dmpings
niets wat hem beweging kan kosten Nu glijden zijn handen
zacht en ongemerkt langs het stuurwiel niets kan het beest
afleiden of aan het schrikken maken
John zit stokstijf voor het stuur Wat moet hij doen
Wat zou jij gedaan hebben in zijn plaatsMelk fluisert hij bijna zonder zijn lippen te
bewegenmelk melk melk
Eindelijk De telegrafist hoort hem mompelen Hij
komt naar voren ziet het slangelichaam loopt vlug het
vliegtuig door naar de stewardess en terug Zijn knien
trillen Doodvoorzichtig zet hij een kopje melk bij de stoel
van de piloot
De list gelukt Langzaam glijdt de mamba van de hals
en de schouders van John naar beneden om gulzig het vocht
op te slurpen Dan rolt zij zich in elkaar en gaat onbeweeg
lijk liggen in een hoek van de cockpit
John besteedt verder geen aandacht aam het beest Een
hoek van en de Kaap laat hij de Kaap De radio geeft
aan de grond de noodzakelijke aanwijzigingen en wanneer de
machine landt zijn alle maatregelen getroffen Twee mannen
in beschermende uitrusting bedwelmen en doden het reptiel
Alleen de passagiers die uitleg vroegen over de terug
keer naar Daressalam kwaden het verschrikkelijke gevaar
waarin zij verkeerd hadden te weten Hoe de slang aan boord
van het vliegtuig was gekomen wist niemand In ieder geval
had de tegenwoordigheid van geest van de piloot mensen
levens gered
Op het vliegveld van de Kaap kondigden die avond de
luidsprekers aan Het lijntoestel uit de richting Daressa
lam landt vanavond met minuten vertraging

OOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOQOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
De morgenstond heeft dure geplombeerde tanden in de mond
Na regen komt modder
Als het kalf verdronken is huilen de koeien
Beter een half ei dan een rotNet heb ik een kat verdronken Uit medelijden Let
wel het laatste wat ik ooit zou doen is een kat verdrinken
maar in dit geval het abattoir is immers om uur s a
vonds al gesloten heb ik zelf het heft in handen genomen
Ondanks Panoramas Roetmop
Toen ik een half uur geleden thuiskwam hoorde ik in
de verte onze hnd verwoed blaffen Niet dat dat zoiets bij
zonders is hij blaft wel vaker maar het kwam me wel
eigenaardig voor dat hij zelfs op de mededeling dat het
eten voor hem klaar stond niet aan kwam stuiven
Om mijn nieuwgierigheid te bevredigen ging ik op
zoek naar mijn makker en het voorwerp van zijn ontstemming
Wat ik zag deed me kokhalzen van afschuw Een grote zwarte
glanzende kat met de Linkeroogbol hangend op zijn neus
terwijl rechts alleen een bloedende oogholte zichtbaar was
stond naar de hond te blazen Bij nader onderzoek bleek de
kat voor de rest totaal ongedeerd te zijn
Mijn conclusie dit kan alleen door een mens gedaan
zijn Als hij met een soortgenoot gevochten had zou hij
ook en vooral elders gewond moeten zijn en bovendien
uitgeput Geen van beide was het geval
Op dit eiland vindt niet alleen de zo vaak geconsta
teerde dierenverwaarlozing plaats nee dit is dierenmis
handeling marteling Uit wraakzucht Ik kan me niet voor
stellen dat eenkat je z het bloed onder de nagels vandaan
kan halen dat je hem voor wraak de ogen mitstoot Mijns
inziens is dit het werk van een paar vernielzuchtige en
plaagzieke jochies waarvan je er hier zoveel tegenkomt
Jongens die s avonds door de straten slenteren om meisjes
lastig te vallen onbeschoft te zijn en dieren te mishande
len Kan hier niets aan gedaan worden Het zou voor veelmeisjes prettig zijn even bij hun vriendin op bezoek te
kunnen gaan een straat verder zonder daarbij de chaperonne
van een stevige broer of vader nodig te hebbenEn het zou
voor veel katten een geruststelling zijn te weten dat hun
avondwandelingetje gemaakt kan worden met behoud van hun
ogen

uit t EngelsLOODSMELTEN MET ZONLICHT
Op de Sciencefair prijkte Leo Henriquez van het La
Salie College met een zonnekachel waarmee hij lood kon
smelten Voor zijn onderzoek verdiende hij een eervolle
vermelding
Wat deed hij
Met een bolle lens en zonlicht kun je een veter la
ten branden We gebruiken dan de lens als brandglas en hou
den de veter in het brandpunt
Toch zal het niet meevallen op deze wijze lood te
smelten Het zou kunnen lukken als we de lichtintensiteit
konden opvoeren Daartoe moeten we over een bolle lens kun
nen beschikken met grote oppervlakte met goede brandpunts
vorming en liefst niet al te dik want dat geeft veel ab
sorptie
Leo had een lens uit Amerika te pakken gekregen met
een diameter cm een brandpuntsafstand cm en een dik
te mm Dit laatste kon want de lens was gemaakt in
de vorm van een plastic schijf gelijkend op een disco
waarin groeven geteld konden werden Zon lens noemt
men een Fresnellens Zulke lenzen gebruiken ze tegenwoor
dig ook voor vuurtorenlichten
Bij het werken met de lens moet je wel een donkere
bril opzetten want de lichtsterkte in het brandpunt is
gevaarlijk hoog
Je mag niet eens met de lens buiten rond lopentj
hebt zo een gat in je broek of je been Je moet altijd
zorgen zelf tussen de zon en de lens te zijn

Gelukkig vult Mito Martis uit Den Bosch een heel stuk van
dit nummer anders Mag dit een f oring zijn voor
jullie allemaal om volgende maand allemaal iets in te stu
ren Je zou bv als uitgangspunt al kunnen nemen dat stuk
je over die imperialistische cultuur Daarin vonden wij
al heel wat aanvechtbare gedachten Wat daarin staat over
het geschiedenisonderwijs gold misschien vijftien jaar ge j
leden Maar we hebben er geen naschrift onder willen zet
tenj we hopen dat het bij jullie wat reacties mag los
slaan Of slikken jullie dat ook allemaal Klim eens in
je pen
De vierde klassers voelen hun einde steeds meer naderen
i Heel kort na de vakantie is het al schriftelijk op
april Bereid je voor En veel succes

IJSChe Guevara hielp mee de Cubaanse bevolking te verlos
sen van een onchristelijk misdadig kapitalistisch
dictatoriaal bewind van Baptista Baptista die gesteund
werd soor Amerikaj die in dat land grote financile be
langen had Als Che Guevara een oportunist was geweest dan
zou hij na de Cubaanse revolutie zijn opgehouden met zijn
revolutionarie praktijken Maar het lot van de  arme
bevolking van Zuid Amerika trok
hem heel erg aan Na een tijd
minister van industrie in Cuba
te zijn geweest besloot hij
naar de Andes in ZuidAmerika
te vertrekken waar hij op een
laffe manier werd vermoord door
de regeringstroepen
De moord op Che Guevara is pas
het begin van de grote revolu
tie in ZuidAmerika die niet
lang meer op zich zal laten
wachten De kerk bisschoppen
en priesters spelen een be
langrijke rol in de revolutie Er zijn ook priesters en
bisschoppen die tegen de revolutie zijn die zijn weer
onder te verdelen in twee groepen De ene groep die
tegen het bloedvergieten is deze wensen dat probleem uit
te vechten aan de conferentie tafel maar zij zullen ook
spoedig inzien dat dit niets uithaalt Men is al meer danvijf jaar bezig en oplossing voor de misstanden te vinden
maar steeds wordt hetpercentage van armen onder de bevol
king gro ter en de schatkist der heerboeren steeds voller
De tweede groep is de zogenaande kapitalistische groep die
hun inkomai krijgen van de rijke aalmoezen van de rijken De
rijken maken er een hele ceremonie van als zij de kerk be
treden zodat de publieke opinie wordt misleid Ze betalen
de pers om fotos van hen te maken als ze de mis bijtonen
Deze rijken zijn moderne farizeers
Wie is een echte christen een boer die uur per dag
moet werken om zijn gezin in levente houden en geen tijd en
kleren heeft om naar de kerk te gaan een boer die veel
houdt van zijn gezin en medemensen f een rijke stinker
die grote aalmoezen geeft op zondag in de kerk en door de
week de oogst van doe boer afneemt waarvoor die laatste
hard heeft moeten werken Wie van de twee is een echte
christen
Ook een groot pionier om de armoede te bestrijden was
de priester Camilo Torres Colombiaan van geboorte De Co
lombiaamse regering bood duizenden dollars voor het leven
van deze christen
Wij kunnen ons niet indenken wat hongerlijden is Wij
krijgen elke dag te eten kleren onderwijs Wij hebben het
goed
De Nederlanders de generatie van even voor de oorlog
hebben schuldgevoelens tegenover de Amerikanen daar zij
door de Amerikanen bevrijd werden van nazibewind En daar
om scharen zij zich achter de Amerikanen welke beslissingen
die ook nemen Een heel volk wordt uitgemoord in Viethamj
het grootste deel van de Nederlanders die deze Amerikaanse
politiek steunen zijn mensen van boven de jaar
Wij kunnen weinig doen voor de mensen in Vietnam in
India Afrika en ZuidAmerika Maar waar wij kunnen moeten
we laten zien dat we de mensen daar een normaal leven gun
nen Vrede voedsel gezondheid voor alle mensen

Er is hier in Nederland een nieuw blad opgericht
door en voor de Antillianen Het blad heet Antiyas Liber
Het bekijkt de sociaaleconomische ontwikkeling van de An
tillen kritisch Er is pas een werkgroep naar de Antillen
geweest om materiaal te verzamen over de mistoestanden
daar Zeer waarschijnlijk zullen ze een verslag uitbrengen
in de vorm van een artikel dat te lezen zal zijn in het
volgend nummer van Antiyas Liber
Materiaal voor het volgend artikel heb ik gehaald
uit de vorige editie van Antiyas Liber Het blad is in ver
staanbare taal geschreven met de bedoeling zoveel mogelijk
mensen te bereiken en de situaties van onze eilanden aan
hen voor te leggen
U kunt zich ook abonneren En dan graag je school en

Het is hetzelfde als een demon die langs een onschul
dig kind loopt zijn vergif achterlatend Daarna verliest
het lichaam van dat kind kracht het wordt slap het begint
te ijlen Spoedig is het gelimineerd
Zo was het ook gedurende onze kolonisatie de gringos
drongen door in ons volk en lieten hun bergif achter zodat
zij ons onze autonomie konden geven en gerust konden ver
trekken en wij maar verrekken Ze lieten ons achter tam
met een geest die ons problemen niet kan zien noch begrij
pen
En al gaan de zaken zo slecht wij menen dat voor het
oog van de buren wij met Sinterklaas cadeaus moeten kopen
voor onze kinderen en ouders Daarom is de zakenwereld zo
blij met Vader en Moederdag en Sinterklaasfeest wanneer
wij hun winkels bestormen om ze dan leeg te kopen terwijl
onze magen knagen losbandig en vol vergif om cadeaus te
kopen
Onze gevoelns zoals onze liefde voor anderen worden
door hen gematerialiseerd om op die wij ze ons uit te buiten
Bekijk die feestdagen goed hoe ze worden genoemd Zijn ze
inheems zijn ze bij ons ontstaan zijn ze in ons voordeel
Daarom ook willen wij dat de auto die bij ons voor de
deur staat groter en duurder is dan die van onze buren
Neem bv april Hoeveel gulden worden er uitgegeven
aan feestverlichtingen vuurwerk en aidere activiteiten
Zou het niet beter zijn al dat geld onder de armen te ver
delen zodat ze ook een week vis of vlees bij hun funchi
kunnen hebben Volgens mij zouden er dan meer mensen geluk
kig zijn en ook de koningin
Waarom moeten wij hun helden eren en huldigen waarom eren
en huldigen wij geen helden van ons eigen volk ras en kleur
Waarom staan onze geschiedenisboeken vol geschreven over
Piet Hein Michiel de Ruyter waar om moeten de Antilli
aansekinderen in koor zingen van heb je wel gehoord
van de Zilveren vloot en in een blauwgeruite kiel
Waarom praten de leraren nooit over een Boy Ecury die
gestorven is om een paar mensenlevens te redden waarom
komen Piar en Brion niet in onze geschiedenisboeken voor
Waarom vertellen ze niks over Tula en Carpata
Ze hebben onze geschiedenis van ons weggerukt om hun held
haftige geschiedenis ons in te prenten zodat wij ona ei
gen niet kennen
Hier worden de winkeljuffrouwen gevraagdom vriende
lijker tegen de Yankees te lachen die onze eilanden be
zoeken Dat moet dat is om onze toeristische industrie
te ontwikkelen Hun volk is ook gemixed net als het onze
Daar lachten de kleurlingen gedurende drie eeuwenheel
erg vriendelijk tegen hen om vooruit te komen om iets te
worden Nu weten we met zijn allen dat zij de wapens heb
ben opgenomen omdat in plaats van vooruit te gaan ze in
krotwijken terecht kwamen Ze hebben geen andere manier
om hun interessen te verdedigen daar zijniet kunnen sta
ken als ervoor hen geen werkgelegenheid is
Zodra ze hun napalm bommen ontwikkeld hadden strooi
den vliegtuigladingen leeg over het onschuldige Vietnamese
volk ze hebben geheime wapens in hun films en tijdschrif
ten
Met behulp van deze medias trachten ze ons te over
tuigen dat de elementen waaruit ons volk bestaat het
slechte ras is op deze wereld In hun films moeten wij
altijd aanschouwen dat de negers indianen en chinezen
de demonen zijn die vernietigd moetenworden Het is
triest om rite zien met hoeveel enthousiasme en hoe ge
boeid wij naar Tarzans film en films over Shina la reina
de la Selva kijken
Het is typisch dat de op onze eilanden verschijnende
dagbladenmet vetgedrukte letters op de voorpaginaons
voorlichten over de oorlog in Vietham en de revolutie insommige Latijnsamerikaanse landen
Deze berichten zijn nzijdig komen alle van de imperi
alistische pers Telkens kun je lezen zoveel Vietcongs ge
dood maar waarom schrijven ze niet dat de Amerikanen elke
week zon a B straalbommenwerpers verliezen boven
Vietnamj waarom niet dat elke gedode Vietcong Amerika zon
ongeveer miljoen kost
En waarom gebruiken ze een hele pagina met sportberich
ten uit Nederland hoeveel goals Ajax en Feyenoord hebben
gemaakt In plaats van deze sportberichten konden ze ons
over ons volk inlichten hoeveel mensen die ene dag niet heb
ben gegeten en onder welke sociale mistoestanden sommige
of meer van onze arbeiders moeten werken

Een grote markt biedt veel voordelen ze maakt de produktie
tegen lagere kostprijs mogelijk door specialisatie van on

levensstandaard van de burgers verbeterd en kan men de hulp
verlening aan de minder ontwikkelde landen vergroten
Politiek gezien komen de Verenigde Staten van Europa in
groter aan zien tegenover de twee grote machten USA en
Rusland
Resultaten op juli zijn de douanerechten geheel
verdwenen vele verlagingen van invoerrechten in Frankrijk

Toen de meneer de klas verlaten had werd het plotseling
in d een kabaal van jewelste De jongens begonnen allerlei
geluiden uit testoten Dat was vrijdag januari s mid
dags vrij voor de kroonprinses
Opeens riep een van de jongens Daar komt de baas
Maar ja een van onze helden maakte zich daar niet druk om
en een heel onmenselijk geluid kwam uit zijn keel
En inderdaad daar stond de baas voor de deur van klas d
Hij keek zo kwaad dat hij er vuurrood van werd
Wie was dat vroeg hij maar hij kreeg geen antwoord
Om twaalf uur blijven jullie allemaal hier begrepen Zijn
jullie helemaal betoeterd
Hij ging weg
Maar in de derde les kwam hij onze klas weer binnen
Hij begon een en ander te zeggen en even later deelde hij
blaadjes uit om de naam van de jongen die geschreeuwd had
op te schrijven
De naam werd bekend
Om twaalf uur blijven begrepen
Maar zei de jongen ik ben niet de enige
Hou je mons lafaard Dinsdagmiddag kom je schrijven Dat
is alles
De jongen hield zijn mond dicht en dinsdagmiddag moest hij
anderhalf uur komen schrijven

te brengen Ik ben er zeker van Mijnheer de Voorzitter dat Uw College
zich volledig bewust is van de zorg die nu meer dan ooit besteed
dient te worden aan het onderwijs van onze kinderen Met de en
werkgelegenheid alhier is het noodzakelijker geworden om de kinderen
een betere opleiding te geven voor hun toekomst Vanaf het begin moeten
de kinderen onder normale omstandigheden les kunnen krijgen Dit is

s morgens naar school gaat en dat een andere
groep van dezelfde klas
s middags terugkomt
om onderwijs te krijgen
soms tot uur
s avonds Sommige onderwijzers moeten daardoor vanaf
half acht tot zes uur op school blijven Zij moeten deze opoffering
brengen Mijnheer de Voorzitter omdat zij bewust zijn van hun taak
Mijnheer de Voorzitter aan de andere kant is de taak van het Bestuurs
collegedus van het Eilandsbestuur
om vooruit te zien en te zorgen dat
er voldoende klaslokalen zijn voor het onderwijsSoms is het zeer moeilijk voor deze onderwijzers om de lesrooster zodanig
te regelen dat het minimum aantal lesuren kan worden bereikte
Ik kan hier spreken van een geval te Santa Cruz bij de bt Jozefschool
waar
er twee zesde klassen zijn die rouleren Dus
s morgens komt een
groep en
s middags komt een tweede groepe ijnheer de Voorzitter
de
gevolgen van deze toestand kunt U zelf voelen Er schijnt iets wars te
zitten in de voorziening
van de noodlokalen
Ik weet niet hoe de toestand
is op de andere scholen van Aruba maar ik denk dat bij deze Scholen het
ook niet veel beter is Mijnheer de Voorzitter
zoals het eruit ziet zal
het ettelijke maanden duren voordat er een oplossing komt
Men schijnt zelfs te vergeten om de inrichting tijdig te bestellen
Mijnheer de Voorzitter als wij straks de lokalen hebben en wij hebben
de inrichting niet tijdig besteld
dan zitten wij nog steeds met de
moeilijkheid De kinderen kunnen niet op de vloer gaan zitten Mijnheer
de Voorzitter
ik wil verder het Bestuurscollege vragen of het wel weet
dat er leerlingen zijn die de toelating geweigerd zouden zijn bij een
of andere school omdat er niet voldoende lokalen zijn
Mijnheer de Voorzitter ik wil nogmaals hier bij het Bestuurscollege
ernstig op aandringen om met de meeste spoed de nodige voorzieningen te
treffen om de kwestie van de noodlokalen tot een bevredigende oplossing
te brengen Mijnheer de Voorzitter
dat is een punt dat ik even wil aan
roerenHen andere kwestie is de zorg voor onze hbes Het schijnt dat het
Bestuurscollege niet langer bereid zal zijn dat er vier eerste klassen
bij deze school gehandhaafd worden per Ll december aanstaande
Ik wil op het ogenblik niet dieper ingaan op dit onderwerp aangezien
mij fraktiegenoot Figaroa een en ander hierover naar voren zal brengen
Ik hoop slechts dat het Bestuurscollege reeds het nodige heeft gedaan
om dit probleem tot cen bevredigende oplossing te brengen zonder daaren
tegen dit onderwijs nu of in de toekomst te belemmeren
lk bedoel hier
mee dat in de toekomst men dit soort onderwijs volledig vrijlaat net
als andere scholen om zich te ontplooien zoals dit thans plaats vindt
Dit is een gezonde groei dat thans begonnen is bij deze school en ik
denk dat wij dit moeten stimuleren in plaats van te belemmeren
Mijnheer de Voorzitter het is juist een goed teken dat er meer belang
stelling bestaat voor dit soort onderwijs
zelfs in deze periode waarin
wij verkeren Meer onderwijs voor onze kinderen is altijd goed
Wij kunnen de kinderen niets beter geven
Ik kan niets anders dan een
ernstig beroep doen op het Bestuurscollege om al het mogelijke te doen
om de kinderensdie nu dreigen te worden ontslagen van deze school om die
te handhaven in het belang van dit onderwijs en in het belang van de toem
komst van onze kindereneDE HEER FDFIGAROA Sefior Presidente primeramente lo siguiente

Mijnheer de Voorzitter allereerst het volgende Laatst hadden wij een
vergadering waarin wij spraken over de technische school op Aruba
Wij kregen toen te horen Mijnheer de Voorzitter dat er de volgende dag
reeds
een bespreking zou plaatsvinden met de leiding van die school
om tot een oplossing te geraken De kinderen zouden niet naar huis ge
stuurd moeten worden integendeel zij moeten
op die technische school
blijven Uit de kranten kwamen wij te wetendat er een oplossing is ge
vonden en wij willen nu slechts weten welke oplossing er werd gevonden S
en welke overeenkomst er gemaakt werd met de onderwijzers
van die school
Wij willen ook gaarne vernemen welke resultaten
de reis van de Gedeputeerde
van Onderwijs naar Nederland heeft gehad en of het waar is dat de personen
die hij bereid heeft gevonden om naar Aruba te komen personen zijn die
hoogstwaarschijnlijk n Nederland zelf geen werkkring kunnen vinden en
of deze personen inderdaad de personen zijn waar de technische school
van Aruba behoefte aan heeft Zoals ik heb vernomen zijn deze mensen
speciaal voor het vak bankwerken maar van de andere kant meen ik te
hebben vernomen dat voor de onderwijzers waar deze technische school
meer behoefte aan heeft meer in de richting van het timmervak en metselen
gezocht moet worden
Dan hebben we nog de toestand bij ons lager onderwijse Dat komt zoals
door mijn collega reeds naar voren werd gebracht vanwege het gebrek aan
lokalen om de kinderen onder te brengen Maar in dit verband is er nog
een punt waarover wij meer inlichtingen wensen te verkrijgen En dat is
het volgonde Laatst kregen een dertigtal dames nadat zij gedurende onge
veer drie jaar een cursus hebben gevolgd om de derderang te halen
te
horen dat zij in de salarisschaal zijn ondergebracht onder verschillende
rangen en dat de salarissen ook overeenkomstig de rangen waren
Nu hebben deze dames zich gedurende drie lange jaren offers getroost en
wij moeten aannemen dat het een ware offer was voor haar om deze cursus
te kunnen volgen Nu bleek dat er bij zijn die een verhoging kregen van
LlOe andere kregen f en weer andere fs
Onder deze mensen waren er die reeds  jaren dienst achter de rug
hebben als kwekelinge als vierderanger en zoe Nu willen wij graag weten
welke maatregelen het Bestuurscollege heeft genomen om deze mensen een
salaris te geven dat volgens het Bestuurscollege haar ook toekomt
Deze mensen moeten wij zeer waarderen voor hetgeen zij gedaan hebben
Onder zeer moeilijke omstandigheden hebben zij gegeven wat zij konden en
wij moeten opmerken dat deze dames in haar taak niet de slechtsten waren
en ook niet de slechtsten zijn nu op die scholenMijnheer de Voorzitter het voornaamste waarvoor wij vanavond hier zijn
samengekomen is het volgende
Tegelijk met de voorbereidingen die gemaakt worden om het feit te her
denken dat wij gedurende jaren in de Antillen in de gelegenheid waren
om van het middelbaar onderwijs te genietenkregen
de kinderen van de lste
klasse van de hebes op Aruba een brief mee voor de ouders van welke
brief de ouders eerst dachtendat het ging om een bijdrage voor de viering
van dit heugelijk feit maar die later bleek in te houden een aanzegging
van het schoolbestuur aan de ouders om hen op de hoogte te stellen van
het foit dat ingaande Ll december kinderen die wettelijk zijn toege
laten to deze school aangezien zij officieel examen daartoe hebben gee
maakt naar huis zullen worden gezonden omdat er geen plaats is voor
hen In de brief zegt men dat er uiteraard een selectie zal plaats vinden
zoveel mogelijk in het belang van de kinderen Nu is het heel moeilijk
nu deze kinderen eenmaal toegelaten zijn tot deze school om na drie maanden
met een selectie te komen Al deze kinderen zijn wettelijk toegelaten tot
het Colegio Arubano Gelet hierop kan deze zaak minder aangename gevolgen
hebben voor degenen die dat niet na willen komen Van de andere kant
moeten wij blij zijn dat onze hbs thans zo ver is dat zoveel kinderen
de kans krijgen om met hun middelbaar onderwijs te beginnen aan die school
Enige tijd geleden hebben wij reeds naar voren gebracht dat het rd
merd om een hbes te beginnen waar de kinderen van de Papiamentssprekende
gezinnen terecht kunnen
Dit is Goddank veranderd en vele kinderen die thuis Papiaments spreken
vooral van de distrikten hebben de examens voor toelating met goed gem
volg gemaakt en thans lopen zij het risico om als eersten naar huis ges
stuurd te worden Daarom zijn wij hier gekomen om het Bestuurscollege
te verzoeken alle mogelijke en nodige maatregelen te nemen om te voor
komen dat per l december as deze kinderen naar huis zullen moeten
worden gezonden en om het schoolbestuur zoveel mogelijk ter zijde te
staan zodat deze kinderen kunnen blijven om hun hogere studie te kunnen
vervolgen
in het volle vertrouwen dat het Gouvernement van Aruba zich
inderdaad interesseert
voor het onderwijs van ons volk Ik dank U
ijnheer de Voorzitter
DE HEER MCROES Mijnheer de Voorzitter met de opening van de hebese Op
Aruba enige jaren geleden ging een innige wens van de Arubaanse bevolking
in vervulling Het werd toen mogelijk om hier op ons eiland zelf middel
baar onderwijs
te volgen hetzij alleen maar voor het middelbaar onders
wijs als inleiding
tot verdere universitaire studie Er heerste overal
de hoop datde hbes voorspoedig zou groeien en tot nu toe kunnen wij
niet ontevreden zijn over de groei
Iedereen heeft bijgedragen om deze groei mogelijk te maken het school
bestuur het Lilandsbestuur en de volksvertegenwoordiging Nimmer werd
tevergeefs een beroep gedaan om fondsen voor de bekostiging van deze
dure schoolopleiding
Nu is het reeds nodig dat een vierde eerste klas
bij de hebese wordt gevoegd Wij waren in september zeer tevreden toen
deze noodzaak bleek en wij hadden nooit kunnen denken dat reeds voor
het eind van de maand de noodzaak om de vierde klas op te heffen reeds
zal blijken
Dit is inmiddels geschied middels een brief van het
schoolbestuur aan de ouders van de leerlingen van alle eerste klassenvan de hbese Grote verslagenheid heerst er natuurlijk onder de bevolking
over deze stap r heerst angst en vrees onder de ouders die na zichvele offers getroost te hebben nu de kans lopen dat hun onderwijs
plannen de bodem worden ingeslagen Deze verslagenheid is nog grover
omdat terwijl wij weten dat er slechts kinderen slachtoffers van
deze beslissing zullen worden het op het ogenblik niet bekend is wie
deze zijn Dus deze onzekerheid heerst onder alle kinderen en
hun ouders
Het is voor ons een primaire noodzaak dat de hbes op
geen enkele wijze wordt belemmerd in haar groei Wij moeten indien
mogelijk nog verdere offers opbrengen om deze e eerste klas te behouden
Welke zijn de wettelijke redenen die daartoe hebben geleid om de vierde
eerste klas op te heffen Is het een gebrek aan financin
is het een
gebrek aan schoollokalen hetgeen ik liever wil aannemen of is het cen gee
brek aan onderwijskrachten
Wat ook de redenen mogen zijn dit is een
nodgeval en wij moeten het ook als zodanig zien op te lossen
Gaarne zou ik van het Bestuurscollege willen vernemen wat haar plannen
zijn in deze zaak en gaarne wil ik vanaf deze plaats mijn volledige
steun toezeggen aan het Bestuurscollege
om een oplossing te brengen
in deze aangelegenheidDaar ik toch over het ondermi iebels id spreek Mijnheer
de Voorzitter
heb ik nog enkele opmerkingen ten aanzien van de mms
Het is het
Bestuurscollege bekend dat onder onze bevolking ook het verlangen
leeft naar de instelling van een mmeSe hier op het eiland
Vele meisjes gaan thans naar Curagao om deze opleiding te volgen en liet
Eilandsbestuur draagt bij in de studiekosten in de vorm van reiskosten
vervoer en huisvestigingstoelage Gaarne zou ik van het Bestuurscollege
willen vernemen hoeveel kinderen op het ogenblik deze huisvestigingstoe
lage en reiskostenvergoeding genieten en of dit bedrag dat thans wordt
uitgegeven het niet wettigt dat het Bestuurscollege een ernstige studie
maakt van de mogelijkheid
om te zijner tijd hier op Aruba een eigen
Arubaanse memese op te richten Ik dank UD HEER BeRFINGK Mijnheer
de Voorzitter de heren Werleman Figaroa en
MCroes hebben gebruik gemaakt van het recht dat vastgelegd is in de
eilandenregeling om een vergadering bijeen te roepen
en
Maar het is weer gebleken
dat deze heren het ons erg moeilijk maken
Als er gevraagd wordt om als agendapunt op te nemen het onderwijsbeleid
van het Bestuurscollege
dan is het voor ons als raadsleden moeilijk om
gepropareerd
hier in deze vergadering over te spreken
Wij weten
in de
verste verte niet waarover deze heren willen spreken en ik geloof wel
dat het de bedoeling is van deze heren dat wij allemaal hier als vertegen
woordigers
van het volk onze stem laten horen over hetgeen ter zake naar
voren gebracht wordt
Ik zie dat er vanavond hoofdzakelijk gesproken is
over de toelating of de eventuele niettoelating
van de kinderen voor de
hebese lEjnheer de Voorzitter
ik moet zeggen dat het voor iedereen
feitelijk een pijnlijke zaak is Aan de andere kant is het ook moeilijk
omdat wij niet precies weten waar feitelijk de moeilijkheid is
Wij hebben begrip dat het Bestuurscollege in deze samenstelling Aruba
een hebess gegeven heeft met de hulp van alle leden van dit College
Wij hebben begrip dat het Bestuurscollege onder andere een Me Ue Le Oe
school geplaatst heeft in Santa Cruz Wij hebben begrip dat het Bestuurs
college de schoolgelden afgeschaft heeft waardoor het mogelijk werd voor
de kinderen van arme ouders om ook de school te kunnen bezoeken Dit zijn
allemaal punten die het beleid van het Bestuurscollege raken
Maar omdat wij niet wisten waarover de drie heren zouden spreken zijn wij
hier gekomen om te luisteren naar wat deze heren te vertellen hadden
De krantenberichten over het geval van de hebeSe Zeggen
dat de commissie
belast met de toelatingsexanenscen fout begaan heeft De kinderen moes ten
zich onderwerpen aan dit examen De uitslagen moesten aan de ouders van
de kinderen bekend maken of de kinderen geschikt waren voor de hebbes Of
niet Volgens
de krantenberichten heeft deze commissie echter aan de
ouders geschreven dat hun kind op de Colegio Arubano is toegelaten
Het Bestuurscollege heeft deze fout niet ongedaan gemaakt volgens de
kranten maar heeft gezegd dat wij deze kinderen tot december zullen
houden Dus een tussenweg die in dit geval niet de juiste was Volgens
mij had het Bestuurscollege toen moeten zeggen Nee er is geen plaats
of het Bestuurscollege had moeten zeggen Gaat Uw gang voor het hele
jaar Dit zijn geen officile gegevens die ik gekregen heb dit zijn
alleen maar gegevens uit de krantenberichten Dus ik ben wel zeer benieuwd
naar het antwoord van dit Bestuurscollege omdat onze fraktie van mening
is dat zoveel mogelijk zoals het de afgelopen elf jaar het geval is ge
weest bij dit Bestuurscollege alle kinderen op Aruba de gelegenheid moeten
krijgenom dat onderwijs te volgen waarin zij zin hebben en als de ouders
willen Als het kind naar de atese wil gaan
dan moet het kind VL
kunnen gaan Dit geldt ook voor de meueleOe
en de lager school dus even
eens voor de hebese Daarom is deze fraktie zeer benieuwd naar het antwoord
van het Bestuurscollege want ook wij zullen zoveel mogelijk ons verzoek
richten om deze kinderen die eenmaal toegelaten zijn en die in december
naar huis moeten toch op school te houden Daarom zullen wij wachten tot
de tweede ronde
om met eventuele voorstellen te komen nadat wij het ant
woord van de Gedeputeerde van Onderwijs hebben gehoord Ik dank UDE HEER JeCLERMANs Seflor Presidente
ami tambe ta di mes
un opinion cu
sofor Finck E hoofdschotel ame nochi ta e asunto di hbese un asunto di
suma importancia pa e poblacion di Aruba y ta pesey cu masha entusiasmog
cu masha sperenza mi ta warda ariba contesta di Bestuurscollege pa sabi

opinion cu una bes cu e hobensitonan y hobensitanan a wordo admiti
na e
hebes aki mi ta spera cu Bestuurscollege lo realisa cu nos tin di haci
tur esfuerso pa mantene
e hobensitonan y hobensitanan aki na e vierde

Vertaling
Mijnheer de Voorzitter ik ben van dezelfde mening als de heer Finck
De hoofschotel vanavond is de kwestie van de hebes een zaak van groot
belang voor het volk van Aruba daarom wacht k met veel enthousiasme en
met veel hoop het antwoord af van het Bestuurscollege om te horen wat
het Bestuurscollege in dit geval denkt te doen Ik ben ook van mening
dat aangezien deze jongelui nu eenmaal toegelaten zijn tot de hebes het
Bestuurscollege wel zal inzien hoop ik dat wij alle moeite moeten doen
om deze jongelui ook in die vierde eerste klasse van de hbs
te hande
havene Daarom wacht ik met veel enthousiasme op het antwoord van het
Bestuurscollege
Ik dank U Mijnheer de Voorzitter
DE HEER LTCHANCH Mijnheer de Voorzitter zoals ik in de kranten ge
lezen heb bestaat het voornaamste
probleem bij de hebese uit het feit
dat de ouders van de kinderen van de hebese een brief hebben ontvangen
van de een of andere persoon van het schoolbestuur waarin staat dat het
mogelijk is dat de kinderen per l december naar huis gestuurd zullen
worden Wat voor autoriteit heeft het schoolbestuur hier Mijnheer de
Voorzitter Ik weet het niet Ik weet alleen maardat het Bestuurs
college de instantie is die dikwijls dergelijke bon moet nemen
Daarom zeg ik Mijnheer de Voorzitter dat als de feiten blijken te zijn
zoals de kranten en andere ze aantoonden
dus zoals ik gelezen heb dan
ligt het aan deze Raad om vanavond een direkte beslissing hierin de
nemen Het is mooi om te zeggen dat het Bestuurscollege hierover een
studie gaat maken of dat het Bestuurscollege met voorstellen zal komen
of dat het bestuur van deze school een fout heeft gemaakt Mijnheer de
Voorzitter het is best mogelijk dat dit bestuur een fout heeft gemaakt
maar als het fouten maakt dan moet er een hogere autoriteit zijn die
deze mensen erop moeten wijzen
dat zij deze fouten hebben gemaakt
en dan
degelijke
beslissingen in deze zaak nemen Ten eerste als het hoofd van
deze school de beslissing had genomen dat deze kinderen op deze school
toegelaten moeten worden door een toelatingsexamen
dat afgenomen werd
door het hoofd van deze school en andere leden dan meen k dat het
Bestuurscollege in de toekomst dit toelatingsoxanen strikt onder het
gezag van de Inspecteur van Onderwijs moet laten houden
Ten tweedeom geen brieven te laten uitgaan van het een of ander schoole
bestuur maar dat het Bestuurscollege eerst besprekingen voert met het
schoolbestuur en nagaat of de mogelijkheid bestaat of deze kinderen op
school kunnen worden toegelaten of niet Mijnheer
de Voorzitter ik denk
dat als deze kinderen naar huis gestuurd worden in december
er een grote
fout zal worden begaan Daarom doe ik dit voorstel niet alleen aan het
Bestuurscollege omdat het Bestuurscollege zal zeggen
dat zij het voor
stel zal gaan bestuderen Wijnheer de Voorzitter de kinderen moeten
studeren op de hebese Daarom doe ik een voorstel aan de hele Eilandsraad
vanavond dat wij hier een beslissing nemen dat de kinderen van de vierde
eerste klas van de hebes aanblijven tot het volgend jaar dat zij naar
een andere klas mogen overgaan of blijven zitten
Ik dank U Mijnheer de
Voorzitter
DE HEER DGCROES
Sefior Presidente ora ma haya e invitacion pa e
reunion awe nochi el a haci mi pensa hopi ariba e situacion di ensefianza
na Arubae Como miembro di e fraccion
di nos partido den pasado semper nos
a trece critica constructivo ariba e gobernacion di ensefianza di Bes tuurse
college actual y gobernacion di ensefianza di Bestuurscollege den pasado
perteneciendo na e mesun partido politico cu actualmente ta sinta aki como
gobierno di isla di Aruba
jSelor Presidente
ta fresco den mi memoria ainda tempo cu Eilandsraad di
Aruba a nombra un comision entre su miembronan pa bishita tur schoolnan
di Aruba y pa dirigi un rapport na Bestuurscollege ariba e situacion di
e schoolnan di Aruba y ensefianza en general na Aruba Despues
di un
trabao grandi di e comison nombr pa Eilandsraad
e comision a somete un
rapport xtenso na Bestuurscollege cu tur e problemanan cu tabata ie
durante e tempo ey cu e comision a haci un investigacion ariba tereno di
ensefianza
na Aruba IE no ta culpa e actual Bestuurscollegepero
parti
di e Bestuurscollege aki nos mester culpa pasobra Bestuurscollege no a
haci ningun clase d e esfuerso pa cumpli eu deseo di e comision a base
di nan investigacion y a base di e rapport dirigi na Bestuurscollege den
pasado ariba e situacion desagradable tocante e ensefianza di Aruba
Tambe na varios ocasion den pasado nos partido a pleita ariba e situacion
di ensefanza na Aruba pero ta lamentable di bisa cu Bestuurscollege
faya considerablemente ariba e tereno di ensenanza di Arube
Sea
Bestuurscollege a faya asina tanto cue situacion di ensefianza a yega
na su punto di culminacion ora cu tres miembro di fraccion di oposicion
a pidi pa discuti e problema aki awe nochiVarios otro miembronan di partido di oposicion y tambe otro miembronan
di partido di gobierno den pasado a remarca y a observa fuertemente
durante debatenan di tratamento di presupuesto
di Aruba ariba e situacion
di ensefianza na Aruba cu ta laga hopi di desea ainda E situacion di
ensefianza na
Aruba ta laga hopi di desca pa falta di mal gobernacion di
Bestuurscollege Nos mester culpa e Bestuurscollege actual pa e situacion
na Colegio Arubano
Mi no ta accepta ningun clase di contesta for di
Bestuurscollge
ora Bestuurscollege por bin back despues y bisa cu si e
muchanan di hebes aki mester bay cas ta pa falta di placa y cu nan
no por mantene mucha na school Si Bestuurscollege bin cunele mi no por
accepta esey pasobra nos sabi cu placa ta wordo gast malamentey in
hustamente pa e actual gobierno di e isla di Aruba

et
Segun mi por a lesa den corant Sefior Presidente poco dia pasa un hefe

promer clas di Colegio Arubano Den e carta ey nan por a lesa cu na fin
di afa mas o menos mucha cu actualmente ta asistiendo school na
Colegio Arubano mester bay cas of mester acudi na otro school llanera
mi colega na otro banda a bisa mi no ta kere cu e maestro di school tin
autorisacion pa dirigi cierto cartanan na mayornan pasobra segun mi
opinion Bestuurscollege ta cuerpo mayor cu tin derecho pa dirigi carta na
mayornen respeto e situacion
di Colegio Arubano
ee
Manera bo sabi Sefior Presidente tabata tin hopi sacrificio pa banda
di e muchanan di Colesio Arubano cu ta den promer klas pa nan a haya e

Nos mester comprende cu mayornan a haci gasto grandi pa e muchanan aki

promer falta tabata cu e hefe di e school no tabata tin ningun derecho
di tuma e paso manera el a tuma di dirigi e carta na e mayornan di e
muechanan cu ta studia den promer klas di Colegio Arubanoe Nos como repre
sentante di pueblo di Aruba a wordo eligi cu votonan popular di Aruba y
a hura dilanti bo mes Sefior Presidente y toch nos no a haya nada di
esaki Oficialmente Bestuurscollege di Aruba no por ta tin e minimo
interes di dirigi un carta of yama un reunion di Eilandsraad pa trece
e situamcion aki na conocimento di representantenan di pueblo cu a wordo
elig pa mayoria di voto di Aruba Bestuurscollege mester comprende cu nos
ta e representantenan di pueblo cu a wordo eligi y no Bestuurscollege
Ta e representantenan di pueblo a pone Bestuurscollege na unda Bestuurs

e school aki no wordo mand na cas of na un otro school Te asina leuw
e situacion na Colegio Arubanoe
HD tin situacion desagradable na Aruba den diferente districtonan
tocante e situacion di ensefianza y condicion di e schoolnan
E situacion y e condicion di e schoolnan den diferante districtonan nos
por considera masha desagradable Desagradable pasobra Bestuurscollege
no tabata tin suficiente interes pa drecha e situacion aki
Bestuurscollege di Aruba a haya amplio tempo pa studia y haci cambionan
necesario pa mehoracion di condicionnan di ensefianza na ArubaSegun mi ta comprende cu hasta tin lokaalnan di emergencia na unda
muchanan mester sinta pa haya ensefanzae
E situacion aki no mester ta na Aruba pesobra nos tin suficiente fondo
pa e situacion aki no ta asina Nos tin suficiente fondo ora cu nos mire
con Bestuurscollege ta gasta e placa di pagadornan di belasting pasobra
tin hopi gastonan cu a tuma lugar di menos importancia cu ensclianza
sey
mi no ta cita na e momento aki pero si e ta necesario lo mi bisa
den segundo rondo y mencion e situacion di gastamento di placa innecesario
y
nan ta larga situacionnan mucho mas importante y necesario un banda
Lokaalnen di emergencia no mester a ser permiti Tambe segun mi ta com
prende cu ainda tin school na Aruba cu no tin coneccion ariba Hvater
cooler Ho obstante argumentonan den pasado di diferente miembronan den
Eilandsraad no obstante cu diferente miembronan di Eilandsraad a hala
atencion di Bestuurscollege no obstante cu organisacionnan na Aruba

Ie aheen de Voorzitter Ean ik de uitnodiging ontving voor de vergadering
wan hedenavond heb ik zwaar moeten denken over de toestand van het onder
wijs op Aruba Als lid vande fraktie van onze partij heb ik in het ver
leden steeds opbouwende kritiek uitgebracht op het onderwijsbeleid van hethuidige Bestuurscollege en het onderwijsbeleid van het Bestuurscollege
in het verleden behorende tot dezelfde politieke
partij die thans hier
als Eilandsbestuur zitting heefteen
Iijnheer de Voorzitter het ligt mij nog vers in het geheugen toen de
Eilandsraad van Aruba een commissie benoemde
uit haar leden om al de
scholen op Aruba te bezoeken en rapport uit te brengen aen het Bestuurs
college over de toestand van de scholen op Aruba en over het onderwijs
in het algemeen
op Aruba Na een groot werk van deze commissie benoemd
uit de Eilandsraad heeft de commissie een lijvig rapport aangeboden aan
het Bestuurscollege met al de problemen
die bestonden toen de commissie
dat onderzoek gedaan heeft
op het gebied van het onderwijs op ArubaIk beschuldig niet het huidige Bestuurscollege maar ik moet wel een
deel van dat College beschuldigen
want het Bestuurscollege heeft zich
geen enkele moeite getroost om gevolg te geven aan het verlangen van de
commissie gebaseerd
op haar bevindingen naar aanleiding
van dat onder
zoek en naar aanleiding van het rapport gericht aan het Bestuurscollege
in het verleden ten aanzien van onaangename toestand van het onderwijs
op Aruba
En
IE
Onze partij heeft ook verschillende malen in het verleden betoogd over
de situatie
van het onderwijs
op Aruba maar jammer genoeg moet ik zeggen
dat het Bestuurscollege schromelijk gefaald heeft op het gebied van het
onderwijs op Aruba Het Bestuurscollege
heeft zo erg gefaald
dat de
toestand van het onderwijs haar toppunt bereikte
toen drie leden van
de fraktie van de oppositie vroegen om dit probleem vanavond hierin te
bespreken Verschillende leden van de fraktie van de oppositie en ook
andere leden van de bestuursfraktie hebben in het verleden in de betogen
bij de behandeling van de begroting van Aruba erop gewezen en met klem
opgemerkt dat de toestand van het onderwijs op Aruba veel te wensen
overlaat Het onderwijs op Aruba laat veel te wensen over vanwege het
slechte beleid van het Bestuurscollege Wij moeten het huidige Bestuurs
college de schuld geven voor de toestand bij de
Colegio Arubano
Ik aanvaard geen enkel antwoord van het Bestuurscollege wanneer het
Bestuurscollege hierop terugkomt en zegt dat wanneer deze kinderen
naar huis gestuurd moeten worden dit te wijten zal zijn aan gebrek aan
geld en dat zij daarom deze kinderen niet op school zullen kunnen
houden Indien het Bestuurscollege daarmee komt aandragen dan zal ik
dat niet kunnen aanvaarden want wij weten dat het geld op verkeerde
wijze en onheus wordt uitgegeven door het huidige bestuur van het
Eilandgebied Aruba
Zoals ik enkele dagen geleden heb kunnen lezen in de krant lijnheer de
Voorzitter heeft een schoolhoofd
ik geloof dat het een onderwijzer
was van Colegio Arubano enkele dagen geleden een brief gericht aan de
ouders van de kinderen
van de lste klasse van Colegio Arubano
In die
brief konden zij lezen dat tegen het eind van het jaar ongeveer
kinderen die thans Colegio Arubano bezoeken naar huis moeten of naar
een endere school gaan Zoals mijncollega aan gene zijde gezegd heeft
geloof ik niet dat die onderwijzer de bevoegdheid heeft
om dergelijke
brieven te richten aan de ouders want volgens mij is het Bestuurscollege
de hogere instantie die bevoegd is om brieven te richten aan de ouders
met betrekking tot de situatie op Colegio Arubanos Zoals U weet Mijnheer
de Voorzitter zijn er door de kinderen van Colegio Arubano die in de
eerste klas zitten veel offers gebracht om in de gelegenheid te worden ge
steld naar Colegio Arubano te kunnen gaan dit jaarDie kinderen zijn wettig toegelaten zoalsmijn andere collega reeds zei
Zij moesten een examen afleggen en hebben dat ook met goed gevolg gemaakt
om toegelaten te worden tot Colegio Arubano Toen de kinderen toegelaten
wrden tot Colegio Arubano vulden hun harten zich natuurlijk met blijd
schap en ook de harten van hun ouders omdat zij werden toegelaten tot
het middelbaar onderwijs
hn
EL
Wij zijn allen blij dat wij middelbaar onderwijs op Aruba hebben
Deze ouders hebben aanzienlijke onkosten gemaakt zodat hun kinderen deze
school kunnen bezoeken Nu krijgen zij die bewuste brief en als volksver
tegenwoordiger
kan ik een dergelijke brief gericht aan de ouders niet
goedkeurene Wij moeten begrijpen
dat die ouders grote onkosten hebben
gemaakt voor die kinderen om het middelbaar onderwijs te kunnen volgen
Ik geloof dat de eerste fout lag bij het hoofd van de school die niet
bevoegd was om de stapdie hij genomen heeft
te nemen en die brief uit
te laten gaan aan de ouders van de kinderen die in de eerste klas van
Colegio Arubano zitten Wij als raadsleden werden gekozen met de stem
men van het volk van Aruba en hebben in Uw handen zelf de eed afgelegd
Mijnheer de Voorzitter
en toch hebben wij nietshierover gezien of
ontvangen
Het Bestuurscollege van Aruba heeft niet de minste interesse
tentoongelegd om een brief te richten aan de Raad of een vergadering
van
de Lilandsraad bijeen te roepen om deze toestand onder de aandacht te
brengen van de volksvertegenwoordigers
die gekozen werden met de grootste
meerderheid van stemmen van Aruba Het Bestuurscollege moet begrijpen
dat wij de volksvertegenwoordigers zijn die gekozen zijn en niet het
Bestuurscollege De volksvertegenwoordigers hebben het Bestuurscollege
daar geplaatst waar het vanavond zit Ik geloof dat het Bestuurscollege
verplicht is de volksvertegenwoordigers naar behoren in te lichten over
dergelijke toestanden
Ik hoop dat het Bestuurscollege het verzoek in
overweging zal nemen van de leden van de verschillende frakties die
alle moeite doen om van het Bestuurscollege gedaan te krijgen dat de
kinderen waarvoor de ouders zoveel onkosten hebben gemaakt om die
school te kunnen bezoeken niet naar huis worden gezonden of naar een
andere school Tot zover de toestand bij Colegio Arubano
Er bestaat ook een onaangename toestand op Aruba in de verschillende
distrikten
ten aanzien van het onderwijs
en de toestand van de scholen
De situatie en conditie van de scholen in de verschillende distrikten
kunnen wij zeer onaangenaam noemen Onaangenaam omdat het Bestuurscollege
niet voldoende interesse heeft gehad om deze toestand te herstellen
Het Bestuurscollege heeft ruimschoots de tijd gehad om een studie te
maken van en de nodige veranderingen te brengen in de toestand van het
onderwijs op Aruba
Als ik het goed begrijp dan zijn er zelfs noodlokalen waar de kinderen
ondergebracht zijn om onderwijs te krijgen Deze toestanden moeten niet
bestaan op Aruba omdat wij over voldoende fondsen beschikken waardoor
deze toestand niet zo hoeft te zijn Wij hebben voldoende fondsen
wanneer wij zien hoe het Bestuurscollege het geld van de belastingbetalers
uitgeeft want er zijn vele uitgaven die ge daan worden voor dingen die
minder belangrijk zijn dan het onderwijs
Ik wil dat nu niet aanhalen
hier maar indien het nodig is zal ik dit in de tweede ronde naar voren
brengen en omstandigheden van uitgaven noemen van gelden die onnodig
worden uitgegeven terwijl men belangrijker
en noodzakelijker zaken
terzijde laat Noodlokalen moeten niet worden toegelaten
Als ik het goed heb zijn er ook nog scholen op Aruba die geen water
koelers hebben Niettegenstaande de vele argumenten die in het verleden
naar voren zijn gebracht door verschillende raadsleden niettegenstaande
het feit dat verschillende raadsleden de aandacht van het Bestuurscollege
erop hebben gewezen niettegenstaande het feit dat instellingen op
Aruba hebben bijgedragen
tot de aanschaf van vele waterkoelers op Aruba
toch bestaan er nog op Aruba van die toestanden op scholen waar er geen
waterkoelers zijne Ik verzoek het Bestuurscollege om hiervan een studie
te maken en zo gauw mogelijk waterkoelers
te plaatsen op die scholen
waar men nog geen Koud water kan krijgen
Mijnheer de Voorzitter
ik sluit mij ook aan bij de overige leden van de
oppositie om het Bestuurscollege
van Aruba te verzoeken om niet toe testaan dat die kinderen naar huis worden gezonden eind van het jaar
Ik dank U Mijnheer
de Voorzitter

Mijnheer de Voorzitter het onderwijs op ons eiland is een zaak
van de
eerste orde Gelet daarop hebben wij in het verleden dan ook kunnen zien
dat het Bestuurscollege alle moeite heeft gedaan ter verbetering en stie
mulering
van het onderwijs op ons eilandAre
Wij hebben kunnen zien dat het onderwijs zich heeft uitgebreid door de
energteke inspanningen
van het Bestuurscollege voor de verdere ontwikke
ling van ons onderwijsTen eanzien van het probleem van e
Colegio Arubano waar het school
bestuur een fout zou hebben begaan zoals wij dat hebben kunnen lezen
in de krant en zoals verschillende van mijn collegas naar voren hebben
gebracht wil ik het volgende opmerken
j
Zoals mijn collega Finck zei had het Bestuurscollege inderdaad een
beslissing moeten nemen
omof de kinderen niet naar school te laten
gaan of die kinderen op school te laten blijven gedurende het gehele jaar
dus  Ik kan mij het standpunt van het Bestuurscollege wel
indenken Al werd er een fout begaan toch heeft het Bestuurscollege
deze toestand laten bestaan Door deze toestand nu heeft de oppositie
partijen deze vergadering vanavond bijeen kunnen roepene
Mijnheer
de Voorzitter ik geloof dat ik om meer in bijzonderheden te
treden eerst moet wachten en kijken wat de beslissing van het Bestuurs
college zal zijn Maar reeds van te voren wil ik stellen dat ook ikgaerne zag dat deze kinderen die volgens het schoolbestuur naar huis
gaan op school zullen blijven en ik wil mij nu beperken totdat wij het
antwoord weten van het Bestuurscollege
Ik dank U Mijnheer de Voorzitter
DE IER DFLAMING Seflor Presidente en vista c e reunion di awe nochi

Vertaling
Mijnheer de Voorzitter in verband met de vergadering
die vanavond bij
een werd geroepen door drie van mijn collegas met betrekking tot het
probleem dat bij Colegio Arubano bestaat wil ik het volgende naar voren
brengene Wij weten heel goed dat het onderwijs zich hier in de laatste
Jaren tot een zodanig hoog niveau heeft ontwikkeld dat wij thans verheugd
zijn dat de buitendistrikten
van Aruba van meuloonderwijs genieten
Die mogelijkheid bestond vroeger niet Deze mogelijkheid kwam pas enkele
Jaren geleden tot stand Colegio Arubano is een ander projekt dat duide
lijk werd toegejuicht door de gehele Arubaanse bevolking
Dit bestaat nog niet zoveel jaren Kosteloze schoolbezoek werd beschikbaar
gesteld voor alle kinderen op Aruba Dit moeten wij beschouwen als het
belangrijkste deel van onze begroting Maar hiermede meen ik slechts bom
wijzen aan te halen van wat er gedaan is op het gebied van het onderwijs
voor onze jeugd op Aruba Niettemin wil ik de wens uitspreken dat het
probleem dat thans bestaat bij Colegio Arubano op een aangename manier
wordt opgelost zodat de kinderen door kunnen gaan met hun middelbare
studie Ik hoop dat de raadsleden dezelfde gedachte zullen hebben vanavond
en dat de kinderen dan ook kunnen blijven schoolgaan op Colegio Arubano
ik geloof dan ook niet dat wij de kinderen naar huis kunnen sturen wart
het onderwijs is de Fundamentele basis voor alle jongelui die zich be
schikbaar moeten stellen om hun volk te dienen Ik geloof dat het hier
iets is van het grootste belang waar wij thans over debatteren en ik
hoop dat het Bestuurscollege en de hele Raad eensgezind zullen zijn om
dit kleine probleem te kunnen oplossen
Ik dank U Mijnheer de Voorzitter
Dl
HEER D TROMP GEDEPUTSERDE Mijnheer de Voorzitter om te beginnen zou
ik een beroep willen doen op de leden van deze Raad om het probleem van
de Colegio Arubano zoveel mogelijk nuchter en zakelijk te bekijken en te
bespreken Laten wij zoveel mogelijk alle sensatie vermijden
Mijnheer de Voorzitter onderwijs is de aanhoudende zorg van ons Bestuurs
college
Wij zijn niettegenstaande het betoog van de heer Werleman
goed op de hoogte van de noodsituatie vooral in de buitendistrikten en
van het rouleersysteem op santa Cruze Er wordt hard aangewerkt Wij
hebben contact met de onderwijzers onderwijzeressen en hoofden van de
scholen Er wordt op het ogenblik gewerkt aan het bestek van de tekeningen
en zoals ik al ingelicht ben zijn die intussen klaar gekomenDe bedoeling is dat zowel de overdekte speelplaats van Savaneta als die
ven Santa Cruz omgebouwd zullen worden in noodlokalen in afwachting van
de EEGscholene Wat de hebese betreft Mijnheer de Voorzitter zal ik
eventjes door willen gaanin de landstaal en ingaan op de verschillende

voor de eerste ronde
Vertaling
Alvorens te beginnen over de kwestie van de hebes wil ik even het pro
bleem aanhalen dat wij op onze technische scholen hadden
Thans heeft het Bestuurscollege contact met de Inspectie van Onderwijs om
de onzerwijzers van de technische school minstens uren per week te
geven Tot nu toe varieert dit van tot maximaal uren
Wij hebben contact met de Inspectie van Onderwijs
en wij hopen dan ook
dat wij dit ook spoedig voor elkaar zullen krijgen
Mijnheer de Voorzitter om de heer Figaroa te antwoorden op zijn vraag
met betrekking tot mijn reis naar Nederland wil ik stellen dat ik gedurende
mijn reis naar Nederland geen moment heb verloren
Ik heb al het mogelijke gedaan Ik heb contact opgenomen met verschillende
instanties van het Antillenhuis
Ik heb zelfs met de ministers gesproken
om enige onderwijzers
te kunnen krijgen voor onze technische scholen op
Aruba Ik heb natuurlijk voordat ik hier wegging samen met Onderwijszaken
een lijst samengesteld van de onderwijzers die hier nodig waren en die
nodig zijn voor onze technische school Wij verwachten dan ook dat spoedig
enige van hen hier zullen aankomen Er zijn onder hen onderwijzers die
de akte NelV hebben dat is voor werktuigbouwkunde Nelectrotechniek en
NJ metaalbewerking
Toen wij contact hebben opgenomen met die personen
konden zij uiteraard niet direkt beslissen on de volgende dag zelf naar
Aruba te komen omdat deze mensen gebonden zijn aan een opzegg gingstermijn
van drie maanden Maar indien alles volgens onze plannen verloopt dan
hopen wij dat per januari aanstaande
het tekort aan personeel bij de tech
nische school niet meer zal bestaan
Het feit dat wij ook meer onderwijzers nodig hebben die les geven in
immeren en metselen trachten wij zoveel mogelijk op te lossen door hetaanwenden van personen van Aruba zelf dus lokaal mensen die vele jaren
praktijk en ervaring hebben in die bepaalde richtingen vooral de mensen
die een lange tijd gewerkt hebben bij de lago in deze bepaalde vakken
De kwestie van de vierderangers die gestudeerd hebben voor kwekelinge
na een harde cursus van drie jaren daar ben ik ook persoonlijk geheel van
op de hoogte Dat is een kwestie waar ons College meer dan maanden
voortdurend
k kan haast zeggen iedere dag aangewerkt heeft want wij
hadden er een zwaar hoofd aan Onder deze personen die geslaagd zijn
voor dat examen waren er enkele bij die andere weer andere
jaren voor de klas hebben gestaan Weer andere hadden jaren als
kwekelinge en A jaren als vierderanger gewerkt Een andere jaar als
vierderanger en jaren als kwekelinge en het was moeilijk voor ons om
En lijn te trekken maar ten lange laatste is het ons na een diepgaande
studie gelukt en ik heb zelf met verschillende van deze personan gesproken
en volgens mij zijn zij volkomen tevreden Een van de redenen waarom wij
met die cursus voor derderanger moesten komen was het feit dat op den
duur wij de vierderangers moesten opheffen op onze scholen
De kwestie van de Colegio Arubano Mijnheer de Voorzitter onnodig opge
blazen Tot nu toe zie ik het probleem niet zo groot Wij hebben een
toelatingscommissie en die laat de kinderen een examen doen en al met al
hebben wij op de lste september bij Colegio Arubano in de eerste klassen
kinderen Volgens de wet kunnen wij kinderen per klas toelaten
Dat betekent dat er dus voor die extra klas de e eerste klas
kinderen overblijven Nu is het probleem het volgende Mijnheer de Voor
zitter
De toelatingsexamencommissie heeft na die kinderen te hebben geexami
neerd een brief uitgezonden aan de ouders zeggende dat hun kinderen
toegelaten zijn tot de Colegio Arubanoe En hier volgens het Bestuurs
college heeft de cormissie een fout begaan want voordat de commissie dit
had gedaan hadden zij eerst contact moeten opnemen met het schoolbestuur
van Colegio Arubanoe Die toelatingsexamencommissie heeft die brief ver
zonden op l juli en het schoolbestuur heeft het Bestuurscollege een
brief gezonden betreffende de uitbreiding op juli Dat betekent dat
die commissie een besluit genomen heeft voordat het schoolbestuur con
tact heeft opgenomen met het Bestuurscollege dat uiteindelijk het eerst
had moeten beslissen
In het algemeen Mijnheer de Voorzitter moeten wij
daar rekening mee houden Onze bevolking groeit Elk jaar komen er meer
en meer kinderen op school maar van de andere kant groeit onze financiele
inkomen niet zo vluge Integendeel Vergeleken met het vorig jaar ik
kan dit zeggen voordat wij met de begroting komen hebben wij duizend
guldens meer dan het vorig jaar voor onderwijs en volgens de ramingen zal
dit het volgend jaar stijgen tot duizend guldens De fout die geschied
is bij Colegio Arubano lijnheer de Voorzitter dus die fout die de toe
latingscormissie begaan heeft is begrijpelijk Er zijn verschillende
factoren die hierin een rol hadden kunnen spelen Wij hadden onder andere
een ouddirekteur
die weggegaan is een nieuwe die n zijn plaats is ge
komen
en het is ook jammer dat ik toen dit geval zich voordeed in
Nederland was in verband met het aantrekken van onderwijzers voor de
teehnische scholen Nu is het probleem dit dat wij zoveel mogelijk
trachten volledig bevoegde leraren te krijgen voor onze Colegio Arubano
maar daarin zijn wij nog ver ten achter Wij zijn nog ver van hetgeen wij
ons als doel hebben gesteld in dit verband
Thans zijn er op de Colegio
Arubano leraren waarvan
er slechts volledig bevoegd zijn Van de
zijde van het Bestuurscollege verlenen wij onze volle medewerking in
deze door ambtenaren die dit werk goed kunnen doen les te laten geven
op Colegio Arubanos Wij hebben daaronder een ambtenaar van DeOW een
van de Luchthavendienst en een van Water Energie Bedrijf die les geven
op de Colegio Arubano als uurlerareneWatbetreft de brief die het schoolbestuur aan de ouders heeft gezonden
daarin kunnen wij zien dat er niet gezegd wordt dat de mogelijkheid
niet zou bestaan om de e eerste klas van Colegio Arubano te handhaven
Integendeel ik zie dat de beslissing die het Bestuurscollege genomen
heeft een stimulance is voor deze kinderen om goed te blijven studeren
En als het Bestuurscollege per december of eerder ziet dat er meer
dan kinderen zijn die een goed rapport hebben gekregen dan zullen
wij die e eerste klasse aanhouden
EINDE EERSTE RONDETWEEDE RONDE
DE HEER A WERLEMANs Iijnheer de Voorzitter k heb met belangstelling
geluisterd naar de antwoorden van de Gedeputeerde van Onderwijs
en hij
is het roerend met mij eens dat men zo vlug mogelijk te werk moet gaan
om een voorziening te treffen voor de noodlokalen
Ik weet dat men wat
laat begonnen is met de voorbereidingen en nu pas zijn enkele plannen
klaar om aanbesteed te worden Mijnheer de Voorzitter zoals ik reeds
zei zal dit werk enkele maanden duren voordat deze lokalen klaar zijn
Ik hoop dat men ook in deze met de meeste spoed zal werken opdat de
kinderen niet gedupeerd worden
Pee
Verder zegt de gedeputeerde dat men de kwestie van de hbs nuchter
moet bekijken Hij zegt dat men geen sensatie moet wekken Mijnheer de
Voorzitter als er sensatie gewekt is dan is het zeker niet van onze
kant gekomen maar van de kant van het Bestuurscollege
dat geweigerd zou
hebben volgens
de brief om per l december door te kunnen gaan met e
klas van de hebess Dit kan men ondermeer lezen uit de brief van het
schoolbestuur aan de ouders
Verder Mijnheer de Voorzitter kan ik niets anders concluderen uit het
antwoord van de gedeputeerde omtrent dit onderwerp dan dat de ouders nu
wat onrustiger worden Nu zegt de gedeputeerde
dat zij zullen kijken
wat straks de rapporten te zien zullen geven
Ik vraag mij af of er hier
misschien niet op een of andere wijze druk zou worden uitgeoefend op het
schoolbestuur
en op het personeel om zoveel mogelijk van deze kinderen weg
te werken Mijnheer de Voorzitter dit stimuleert geen gezonde groei van
de hebs op Aruba Integendeel Mijnheer de Voorzitter ik heb in be
dekte termen hier een dreigement gehoord van de gedeputeerde
Ik wil van
hem positief vernemen
dat dit geen dreigement is en ik wil de toezegging
hebben van het Bestuurscollege dat het alles in het werk zal stellen om
de normale groei van de hebese
te stimuleren en niet te belemmeren
Mijnheer de Voorzitter
DE HEER FDFIGAROAsSeflor Presidente mi a keda asombr di tende di e
diputado di ensefianza cu e problema di hebs no ta asina grandi manera
nos ta hacitele Sefor Presidente na e momento aki aparentemente e no

Mijnheer de Voorzitter
ik stond verbaasd te horen van de Gedeputeerde van
Onderwijs dat het probleem van de hebes niet zo groot is als wij het
voordoen Mijnheer de Voorzitter op het ogenblik is het niet zo groot
maar het kan nog veel groter worden Zoals ik hierin heb gehoord en
zoals verschillende sprekers hierin naar voren hebben gebracht en volgens
mij hebben zij de brief die de ouders ontvangen hebben wel begrepen
want die brief is niet uitgegaan van het Bestuurscollege maar van het
schoolbestuur Dat neemt echter niet af dat de Gedeputeerde van Onderwijs
thans komt zeggen
dat wij op december zullen zien welke kinderen in
aanmerking komen om op de hebes te blijven Mijnheer de Voorzitter
deze stelling is helemaal fout want toen wij naar school gingen in de
eerste klas en wij kregen een slecht rapport en men had ons toen naar
huis gestuurd dan geloof ik wel dat vele van ons geen school meer
zouden hebben gezien daarna Mijnheer de Voorzitter daarom doe ik hier
een verzoek en ik geloof dat dit verzoek de steun van al mijn collegas
hier zal krijgen want Ten ons de zaak nu duidelijk stellen zoals zij
inderdaad is Deze vergadering werd bijeengeroepen op verzoek van drie
leden van de Hilandsraad die het volk vertegenwoordigen
Daarom zou ik het zeer op prijs stellen dat de discussies die wij over
deze aangelegenheid zullen hebben gezonde discussies zullen zijn
Want wij hebben het hier over het onderwijs dus laten wij enigszins
ee te laten blijken dat ook wij een beetje onderwijs hebben ge
noten
Wat wij gaarne willen weten is het volgende Wij willen weten of
het En van Aruba bereid is de vier eerste klassen van de
hebse
te handhaven over het lopende schooljaar dus het schooljaar
LO
Ten aanzien van de kwestie van de onderwijzers voor de technische school
heeft de gedeputeerde laten weten dat er enkele onderwijzers meer naar
Aruba zullen komen
Ik wil graag weten hoeveel Onder degene die zullen
komen zegt de gedeputeerde
dat er bij zijn voor werktuigbouwkunde
en
bankwerken Nou bankwerkers worden door ons opgeleid om geexporteerd te
worden Voor werktuigbouwkunde heb ik wel kunnen merken dat er enkelen
op komst zijn want degenendie thans in dat vak werkzaam zijn bij de
technische school hebben een bepaalde aanwijzing gekregen dat zij wel
beter kunnen verdwijnen en toevallig zijn dat Arubanen
Om verder te gaan wil ik hier toejuichen dat eindelijk het Bestuurs
college heeft ingezien
dat wij hier op Aruba zelf over geschikte mensen
beschikken die de kinderen het vak kunnen leren onder andere timmeren
en metselen
Ik hoop dat wanneer het Bestuurscollege deze mensen aan
neemt het rekening houdt met de mensen die reeds hun ontslag hebben
gekregen bij de Lago en dat het geen mensen moet gaan lenen bij de
Lago die reeds hun werk daar hebben om hier te komen werken Er zijn
genoeg geschikte mensen
Laat ons hopen dat het Bestuurscollege deze noodzaak ook inziet
Ten aanzien van de personen
die examen hebben afgelegd voor de derderang
ben ik blij te horen dat er personen waren Nog blijer ben ik omdat
het Bestuurscollege gedurende maanden gewerkt heeft om dit probleem op
te lossen zonder een gunstige oplossing te hebben gevonden voor al deze
personen Nu neem ik wel aan dat geen enkele oplossing waar mensen
mee gemoeid zijn tot ieders volle tevredenheid zal strekken Maar zoals
onze Gedeputeerde van Onderwijs zei dat enkelen van haar geheel tevreden
zouden zijn dat wil ik wel in Eke trekken Als van deze mensen
tevreden zijn met deze oplossing dan hebben zij misschien geboft door
een behoorlijke verhoging te krijgen Maar dan blijven er nog personen
over die niet tevreden zijn en dat is de meerderheid
Ik weet dat het misschien niet opportuun was dat
er net als bij hetuitreiken van het diploma aan deze mensen een nogal officiele groep aan
wezig was om die diplomas uit te reiken toch zou het kunnen zijn dat het
Bestuurscollege misschien weer een bijeenkomst hield met deze personen
en haar een uitleg gaf van de toestand Het kan zijn dat het Bestuurscollege
in principe moet aannemen dat zij wel gelijk heeft ten aanzien van de
manier waarop zij tewerk is gegaan want zij zijn geschikte personen en
hebben alle nodige informaties te hunner beschikking Maar misschien kan
het zijn dat door aan deze groep mensen een uitleg te geven dat zij de
beslissing
van het Bestuurscollege wel naar voldoening zullen begrijpen en
aanvaarden
En indien er enig probleem
zou bestaandan kan dat daar naar behoren kunnen
worden toegelicht Laat ons daarom in het belang van het onderwijs in het
bijzonder aannemen dat het merendeel van deze mensen met veel geduld in
onze buitendistrikten werkzaam zijn en laat ons daarom trachten een manier
te vinden om deze aangelegenheid dan ook te regelen Het punt over het lager
onderwijs
dat ik naar voren heb gebracht schijnt eindelijk zijn beslag
te krijgen daar de gehuwde onderwijzeressen haar aanstelling en het geld
dat haar toekomt ingaande de lste juli zouden krijgen Ik denk dat
dt de datum is
Mijnheer de Voorzitter zoals ik de kwestie van de hbs zon beetje kan
begrijpen zou ook voorgesteld zijn dat het beter zou zijn dat het Be
stuurscollege de kwestie van het toelatingsexamen voor deze school regelt
Laat ons niet zover gaan Misschien heeft degene die dit naar voren heeft
gebracht niet begrepen waar het over gaat Maar laat ons reeds vanaf nu
aannemen dat het bepalen van de resultaten van het toelatingsexamen voor
de hebss nooit onder de competentie van het Bestuurscollege zal kunnen
vallen Want het bepalen van die resultaten is nu eenmaal iets dat volkomen
tot de competentie van de schoolcommissie behoort Zodra men examen heeft
gemaakt dat met goed gevolg is bekroond dan heeft men ook recht op de
gunsten die de resultaten van dat examen bieden Zodra dus die kinderen
aan de eisen die gesteld zijn voor de toelating tot de eerste klas van een
hebes voldoen en zij inderdaad ook toegelaten zijn geworden ingaande september
dan s het zeer moeilijk om niet te zeggen onmogelijk om na drie maanen
weer en selectie te houden onder deze kinderen en de rest naar huis te
zenden Wij zouden misschien kunnen stellen dat die kinderen niet tot
Colegio Arubano zijn toegelaten doch tot een hebese Laten wij dit nu
praktisch bekijken Toen het Bestuurscollege vergunning gaf
om op Aruba een
hbse te beginnen heeft zij teglijkertijd de verantwoordelijkheid aanvaard
voor de gevolgen die daaruit zullen voortvloeien
In dit geval zie ik miet
in dat dit nu het guvernement een bom geld zal gaan kosten integendeel
de enige investering waarop het gouvernement later trots op kan zijn is de
investering op het gebied van het onderwijs voor onze kinderen op Aruba Zo
doende hoop ik dan ook dat het Bestuurscollege zich bevestigend zal uit
spreken ten aanzien van de handhaving van de vier eerste klassen van de
hebs gedurende het schooljaar k dank U
DE HEER MCROES Mijnheer de Voorzitter bij de bespreking van het agenda
punt onderwijsbeleid van het Bestuurscollege heb ik mij hoofdzakelijk
beperkt tot bespreking van de hebasekwestie Echter heb ik op het eind van
mijn betoog een vraag gesteld omtrent de situatie van de mms
en hierop
heeft de gedeputeerde niet gereageerd in zijn antwoord Gaarne zou ik hem
hierop willen zien terugkomen in de tweede ronde
Ten aanzien van de hebesekwestie Mijnheer de Voorzitter kan ik het op
n punt heel gloeiend eens zijn met de gedeputeerde Het is geen groot
probleem Wij hebben het nooit als een groot probleem gezien doch wel als
een probleem dat opgelost dient te worden Daarvoor hebben wij deze ver
gadering aangevraagd Nu is het ons om het even of er fouten zijn geschied
of miet en door wie deze fouten zijn gemaakt Een fout die gemaakt is
moet hersteld worden Wie de schuld treft is een andere zaak vooralwanneer het een fout is met zulke grote consequenties Het Bestuurs
college schijnt in deze zaak een beetje te weifelen Eerst zegt het
College ja wij zullen voorlopig een vierde eerste klas instellen en
dan na een tijdje zullen wij deze vierde klas ontheffen Dit is geen
beleid Ben feit dat onder ogen wordt gezien moet hersteld worden
Nu is het de gelegenheid om deze fout te herstellen Verschillende spre
kers in deze Raad hebben zich zuiver genoeg uitgesproken
Op het einde
werdde Gedeputeerde van Onderwijs geheel onverstaanbaar Bedoelt de
Gedeputeerde van Onderwijs dat de in het vooruitzicht gestelde inkrim
ping van deze scholen een gezonde ontwikkeling zou kunnen zijn voor de
leerlingen van deze school Een gezonde ontwikkeling wanneer er leer
lingen binnen een paar maanden naar huis moeten worden gestuurd en dat
deze leerlingen of hun ouders niet op de hoogte zijn wie die zullen
zijne Dit kan geen gezonde stimulans zijn Dit kan geen wedijver zijn
onder de leerlingen om hun best te gaan doen zodat zij op school kunnen
worden gehouden Deze leerlingen hebben reeds het recht gekregen om op
deze school te zijn en voor dit recht strijden wij vanavond
Ik hoop
dat het Bestuurscollege dit zal kunnen inzien en het standpunt van de
Raad zou willen bekrachtigen
Ik dank U
DE HEER HRFINCK Mijnheer de Voorzitter de zaak is een beetje gecom
pliceerd en ik moet U wel zeggen
dat nu wij zo bout portant een standpunt
moeten nemen het niet zo makkelijk is Maar Mijnheer de Voorzitter
laten wij de zaak even nagaan Er is een commissie samengesteld uit des
kundigen belast met het opnemen van leerlingendie zich onderwerpen aan
een toelatingsexamen om toegelaten te worden tot de hbes
Deze commissie Mijnheer de Voorzitter buiten haar bevoegdheid om
schrijft aan de ouders van de leerlingen die met goed gevolg het examen
hebben afgelegd dat hun kind geslaagd is om toegelaten te worden tot de
hebess laar bovendien zegt deze commissie in de brief dat het kind toe
gelaten is tot Colegio Arubano Daar is een fout gemaakt Op juli
volgens de heer Gedeputeerde van Onderwijs dus twee weken later ont
vangt het Bestuurscollege een brief waarbij gezegd wordt dat er dus
door de examencommissie kinderen te veel zijn toegelaten voor Colegio
Arubano Wat had toen de reactie van het Bestuurscollege moeten zijn
Mijnheer de Voorzitter Zij had twee wegen kunnen opgaan De ene
was
melden aan de stichting om direkt een brief aan de ouders te schrijven
en aan van deze ouders zeggen
dat het op een vergissing heeft berust
want er is geen lokaliteit
er is geen plaats
er zijn geen zitbanken en
er zijn geen leraren om deze kinderen op te vangen Dan was de teleur
stellingniet zo groot maar de teleurstelling was van dien aard dat de
ouders nog de tijd hadden om deze kinderen door te laten gaan om de
Hele lsoeschool waar zij vandaan kwamen of op de Be be Se
Het Bestuurscollege bewandelt een tussenweg Meestal is een tussenweg
goed In dit geval was de tussenweg fout omdat het maar een halve weg
wass Het Bestuurscollege nam een beslissing om deze kinderen voorlopig
toe te laten om dan in december na te gaan of het mogelijk is het totaal
aantal leerlingen door te laten tot het einde van het school jaar
We moeten even de andere kant bekijken Mijnheer de Voorzitters
De moeder en de vader zitten thuis en die krijgen een heugelijk bericht
dat hun zoon of hun dochter is geslaagd en is toegelaten op Colegio
Arubanoe Wat er zich allemaal afspeelt dus de briefwisseling tussen be
stuur en stichting en Bestuurscollege daar wisten deze ouders niets vane
Zij zijn blij dat hun kind toegelaten is tot Colegio Arubano
Mijnheer de Voorzitter achter de schermen is dus een spel gespeeld en
alles draait om de kinderen heen Nu krijgen die ouders een brief van
het bestuur van deze stichting waarin bericht wordt dat de mogelijke
heid bestaat dat hun kind in december niet meer de school mag blijven
bezoekeneOp zichzelf Mijnheer de Voorzitter
is dit een grote teleurstelling
maar deze teleurstelling is des te groter omdat dit kind niet meer terecht
kan op een andere school Terug naar de mulo
is moeilijk Er zijn
misschien enkele vakken dat dit kind gehad heeft gedurende deze drie
maanden die verder zijn dan de mulo maar er zijn ook vele vakken
die minder zijn dan de mulo Daarom is het voor de ouders absoluut
onmogelijk om dit kind thuis terug te nemen
Dit kind is dus verplicht
om te blijven tot het volgend jaar september wat inhoudt het verlies
van n jaar Nu zegt het Bestuurscollege bij monde van de heer Gedepu
teerde van Onderwijs dat wij de zaak een beetje op zijn beloop moeten
laten om te zien of in december deze kinderen die te veel zijn naar
huis gestuurd zullen worden Dat is voor mij althans ik ben geen des
kundige op onderwijsgebied
een vreemd geluid U kunt moeilijk nu stellen
dat het waarschijnlijk zal blijken
dat in december kinderen niet vol
doen volgens het leerplan van de eerste klas hbs omdat dit niet gebrui
kelijk is Mijnheer de Voorzitter of wat sterker het is niet de regel
ls het kind voor het eerst thuis komt met een rapport met of onvol
doendes wil dat nog niet zeggen
dat dat kind de klas niet kan volgen
Het eerste rapport mag nog niet zon maatstaf zijn of dit kind een
onderwijs kan volgen of niet Natuurlijk hebben de onderwijzers behalve
de cijfers op het rapport ook een ander inzicht in het kind en
zeggen
dat dit kind ook al zou hij maar twee onvoldoendes hebben de klas niet
kan volgen laar houdt dat kind toch op de hbes Mijnheer de Voorzitter
tot het eind van het schooljaar en spreek dn tot de ouders om liever dat
kind weg te nemen Het kind zal dan n jaar onderwijs hebben gehad al
zou dat kind niet helemaal voor volle het onderwijs genoten hebben
laar om het kind thuis te sturen of terug te sturen op de muloe waar
dat kind maar half bij zit bij de lessen is absoluut onmogelijk
Mijnheer de Voorzitter ik wil niet met een voorstel komen
Ik wil
slechts een verzoek aan het Bestuurscollege doen om alles in het werk te
stellen opdat een vierde eerste klas van de hebes gehandhaafd wordt
Het is zo in deze maatschappij Wij moeten instaan voor alle handelingen
van ons
on dus de consequenties van elke handeling moeten wij aanvaarden
Het Bestuurscollege mag geen schuld treffen in deze zaak Het Bestuurs
college heeft geen fout begaan Het Bestuurscollege is echter nalatig
geweest door niet direkt te handelen en te zeggen Nee mijne heren U
hebt kinderen te veel aangenomen of Laat ze maar komen wij zetten
A eerste hebesklassen Mijnheer de Voorzitter
ik wil nogmaals zeggen
wij hebben dit niet tot een fraktiezaak gemaakt omdat zoals k zei
dit vanavond zo ons werd voorgelegd Onze fraktie heeft deze zaak niet
kunnen bestuderen omdat wij niet wisten waarover deze heren zouden
spreken Haar Mijnheer de Voorzitter ik geloof dat het de wens is
niet alleen van de heren aan de overkant die zonet gesproken hebben
maar ook van alle leden van deze kant en van de gedeputeerden en het
hele Bestuurscollege trouwens dat deze kinderen het volle jaar mogen
blijven in de eerste hebes Ik dank U
De HEER JeGEERMANs Sefior Presidente ta di menos importancia si nos
ripara ken tin fout of ken no tin fout Di mas importancia ta Sefior
Presidente pa haci tur lo posibel pa e mucharnan cu a wordo admiti na e
vierde eerste klas hbs keda
na school Nos por draai e rond met alle
soorten franjes maar dat doet niets ter zake
Si mi por sigui e
Deputado su redenering bon ta parse manera e ta bisa cu tin un horkan

categoricamente na Bestuurscollege y e pregunta ta lo siguientes y
mi ta kere cu tur Eilandsraad ta eens cu mi
Nos kier sa awe nochi si e vierde eerste klas di hebs
ta wordo handhaafd
si of noe i acaso Bestuurscollege bisa NO nos ta bisa Bestuurscollege
cu Eilandsraad lo bisa SI Masha danki Sefior PresidenteVertaling
Mijnheer de Voorzitter het is minder belangrijk dat wij weten wie hier
fout is en wie niet fout is Het is belangrijker Mijnheer om al het moge
lijke te doon dat de kinderen die toegelaten werden tot de vierde eerste
klas hebes op school blijven Wij kunnen er omheen draaien met alle
soorten franjes maar dat doet niets ter zake Als ik de redenering
van
de Gedeputeerde goed volg lijkt het wel of hij zegt dat er een storm is
in een kuipwater Maar Mijnheer de Voorzitter nu wil ik een categorische
vraag stellen aan het Bestuurscollege
en de vraag luidt als volgt
en ik
denk dat de hele Bilandsraad met mij eens is
EN
Wij willen vanavond weten of de vierde eerste klas van de hbes gehand
haafd wordt ja of nee Indien het BestuurscollegeNEE zegt zeggen wij
het Bestuurscollege van te vorendat de Eilandsraad JA zal zeggen
Ik dank U Mijnheer de Voorzitter
Er volgt een opschudding onder het publiek
DE VOORZITTER Ik wil de dames
en heren in de publieke tribune erop wijzen
dat het U niet toegestaan
is om blijk te geven van Uw gevoelens ten aan
zien van hetgeen in de Raadsvergadering naar voren wordt gebracht
U kunt aanwezig zijn maar U wordt geacht stil te blijven Dit is een
waarschuwing
want indien U zich niet onthoudt moet ik volgens het
Reglement van Orde U verzoeken de zaal te verlaten Dus ik doe een dringend
beroep op U indien U de vergadering wilt blijven volgen om volkomen stil
te blijven
DE HEER LA ICHANCE Mijnheer de Voorzitter de geachte heer Gedeputeerde
heeft in zijn antwoord gezegd dat hierin sensatie wordt gewekt Maar
Mijnheer de Voorzitter als er sensatie gewekt wordt dan wordt het niet
gewekt door de leden van deze Raad maar door de brief die de ouders
van deze kinderen van de hebes hebben ontvangen van het schoolbestuur
ondertekend door een zekere mijnheer Servage Dit is de aanleiding geweest
van de sensatie die onder deze ouders gewekt werd Mijnheer de Voor
zitter wij moeten het deze ouders niet kwalijk nemen want zij hebben
gelden uitgegeven om boeken en schoolmiddelen voor hun kinderen te kopen
en nu zitten zij met hun handen vol brieven die zij van een of ander
schoolbestuur hebben gekregen waarin staat dat het mogelijk
is dat hun
kinderen na december
niet meer hun lessen zullen mogen volgen
Mijnheer de Voorzitter het spijt mij dat ik geen genoegen mag nemen
met het antwoord van de geachte heer Gedeputeerde want Mijnheer de Voor
zitter het antwoord dat de gedeputeerde gegeven heeft is voor mij al
thans
voorwaardelijk Mocht het blijken dat deze kinderen met go ed
gevolg het cerste trimester hebben doorlopen dan mogen zij volgens het
Bestuurscollege hun lessen volgen
Ik vind dit een foutieve gedragslijn
van het Bestuurscollege althans van de gedeputeerde Deze kinderen zijn
wettelijk toegelaten nadat zij hun toelatingsexamen hebben gedaan
Mijnheer de Voorzitter misschien niet op het Colegio rubano maar in
ieder geval tot een hbs Wij hebben een hbs hier op Aruba en wij
moeten zorgen
dat wij onderwijzers krijgen ergens vandaan om deze kinderen
les te geven of als er gelden nodig zijn om een vierde eerste klas te
handhaven
dan moeten wij deze gelden op de een of andere manier zien
op te brengen Daarom wil ik aan het Bestuurscollege ook de categorische
vraag stellen of het Bestuurscollege bereid is om door te gaan met deze
vierde eerste klas Indien dit niet het geval is Mijnheer de Voorzitter
dan hanthaaf
ik mijn voorstel om hoofdelijke stemming De Raad kan zich
dan uitspreken en het Bestuurscollege opdragen deze vierde eerste klas
van de hebes voor het komende jaar  te handhaven
Ik dank U Mijnheer de Voorzitter

jongelui op Colegio Arubano
In verband met de waterkoelers heb ik ook
teen antwoord gekregen Volgens mij is de gedeputeerde helemaal in zijn
antwoorden vastgeraak en hij heeft verscheidene vragen van de raadsleden
vergeten op het gebied van onderwijs Vanavond ben ik tevreden omdat de
argumenten van de oppositie verschillende leden van de gouvernementspartij
in overeenstemming waren met de opbouwende argumenten van de oppositie
Hen van de leden heeft openlijk de argumenten van de oppositie gesteund
Mijn collega aan de andere kant heeft zelfs van te voren gezegd dat aishet Bestuurscollege het niet eens is om die jongelui op de Colegio
te handhaven zal hij als raadslid en behorende tot de gouvernements
partij wel stemmen om de jongelui op de Colegio Arubano te handhaven
De heer Jose Geerman zal natuurlijk van de zijde van de oppositie ook
een stem van vertrouwen krijgen om deze jongelui op school te laten
blijven Nogmaals verzoek ik het Bestuurscolleg en de Gedeputeerde van
Onderwijs om meer concrete en duidelijker antwoorden te geven aan de
Raadsleden op de vragen die zij vanavond naar voren hebben gebracht
Ik dank U lijnheer de Voorzitter
DE HEER LVBRITTEN Hijnheer de Voorzitter ook ik ben niet helemaal
overtuigd door de woorden van de betrokken gedeputeerde
Wij hebben een aantal vragen gesteld onder
andere of de vierde eerste
klas gehandhaafd kan worden maar het antwoord van mijn collega de
gedeputeerde
was niet zo duidelijkIk zou ook een categorisch antwoord in deze zaak willen hebben Gaarne
wil ik vernemen of deze vierde eerste klas gehandhaafd zal kunnen worden
Ik dank U Mijnheer de Voorzitters

Wij willen die verzekering krijgen van het Bestuurscollege en wij hebben
bovendien erbij gevoegd
dat het Bestuurscollege haar best zal doen om
de ontwikkeling en groei van onze hbes op Aruba te blijven steunenzoals
ik reeds gezegd heb het onderwijs is de voornaamste basis voor onze
jeugd Daarom werd deze zaak dan ook in de Raad gebracht vanavond
Ik hoop dat de raadsleden en het Bestuurscollege vanavond een beslissing
zullennenen opdat wij deze kinderen
op school kunnen handhaven tot het
volgend jaar Ik dank U Mijnheer de Voorzitter
DE VOORZITTER Hiermede zijnwij gekomen aan het einde van de tweede ronde
voor wat betreft de raadsleden Het Bestuurscollege zal thans overgaan tot
beantwoording in de tweede ronde
Ik geef thans het woord aan de Gedepu
teerde van Onderwijs
de heer De Trompe
DE HEER D TROMP GEDEPUTEERDE Mijnheer de Voorzitter om te beginnen zou
ik op de eerste plaats weer terug willen komen op de kwestie van de hebesa
Het is zo Mijnheer de Voorzitter
dat het Bestuurscollege nooit anders
gewild heeft dan dat de hbs dus Colegio Arubano zich zal blijven uite
breiden Natuurlijk moet het allemaal gaan volgens
de procedures
Er is een fout gemaakt door de toelatingscommissie Daarna is er meu het
Bestuurscollege overleg gepleegd door de waarnemend direkteur van doColegio De direkteur van Colegio Arubano kwam met het voorstel
Zolang dit probleem hangende is dus zolang er een studie van gemaakt
wordt blijft de eerste klas gehandhaafd tot december Maar dat wil
niet zeggen
dat wij op december pas de zaken zullen gaan bekijken om
dan een beslissing te nemen voor de rest van het schooljaar
Dit probleem heeft onze voortdurende aandacht Er wordt druk overleg ge
pleegd en wij hopen spoedig tot een oplossing te komen
In ieder geval
Mijnheer de Voorzitter wij van onze kant
zullen blijven werken en strijden
om deze vierde eerste klas te handhaven Dit op de eerste plaats want
een misverstand brengt altijd andere misverstanden met zich mee
Op een vraag van de heer Croes over de mms
wil ik het volgende zeggen
Uijnheer de Voorzitter in mammoetwet werd daarover nogal veel gesproken
en geschreven Het Bestuurscollege denkt in de richting van een heaevee
opleiding Dat is een opleiding zowel voor jongens als voor meisjes
Het aantal huisvestigingstoelage is Het aantal werd voor dit schooljaar
overschreden tot over de

Mijnheer de VoorzitterVertaling
Betreffende de vraag van de heer DGCroes over waterkoelers moet ik
zeggen
dat dit een oude geschiedenis is die wij te horen krijgen in
lle vergaderingen bij de begrotingsbehandeling
Volgens mij zijn waters
koelers niet zo belangrijk als schoolvoeding En dat heeft ook aldoor
onze aandacht
Betreffende het rapport waarover de heer Croes gesproken heeft dus het
rapport dat gemaakt zou zijn door de commissie enkele jaren geleden naar
aanleiding van een bezoek aan de verschillende scholen moet ik zeggen
dat ik een rapport gezien heb van een drietal bladzijden heel dunnetjes
maar dat rapport was volgens mij niet opgesteld door de commissie toenDE VOORZITTER Ik wil thans de aandacht er op vestigen dat dit voorstel
slechts het verzoek aan het Bestuurscollege doet om maatregelen te treffen
Ons antwoord kan slechts wezen dat wij bereid zijn dit in beraad te nemen
en na te gaan hoever dit mogelijk is Een concreet antwoord zoals enkele
leden verzoeken
is op dit moment niet mogelijk en thans zou ik dus ook
een en ander willen toevoegen aan hetgeen door de betrokken gedeputeerde
naar voren is gebracht omdat ik de indruk krijg dat de zaak nogal een
zijdig wordt bekeken besproken en behandeld Niet alleen in de Raad
naar ook buiten de Raad Ik geloof dat er geen verschil van mening bestaat
over het beleid wat betreft het onderwijs De verlangens naar voren Ze
bracht ten aanzien van de hbs worden voor gesteund door het
Bestuurscollege Het is dit Bestuurscollege
dat het mogelijk heeft ge
maakt dat de hebs
in de afgelopen Jaren zo gegroeid is Zoals de he
trokken gedeputeerde reeds Haar voren bracht bestaan er nu reeds drie
eerste klassen drie tweede klassen drie derde klassen een vierde klas
A een vijfde klas A twee vierde klassen B en een vijfde klas B
Plus nog een vierde klas C een vijfde klas C een eerste klas voor
onderwi jzersopleiding en een tweede klas voor onderwijzersopleiding
Dit is geschied in een paar jaar dat dit hbs bestaat Dat is eon
enorme groei en het Bestuurscollege is het volledig eens met U dat het
onderwijs
van het grootste belang is voor de toekomst voor Aruba en haar
bevolking Wij zijn het ook mee eens dat de hbs daar ook onder valt
zn
Wij zijn het er echter niet mee SENS wanneer U zegt dat een gezonde
groei van de hebs betekent dat eenieder die naar de hbs wil gaan
et
daar naar toe moet kunnen gaan Dit is Seen gezonde groei Het is ons
namelijk bekend dat er Op de hbs vele leerlingen zitten die daar
niet thuis horen Dit is niet in het belang van de hebs
en ook niet in
het belang van de Leerlingen zelf Het sa in het belang van de leerlingen
zelf dat zij bijtijds op een school worden geplaatst waar alg thuis
AE
horen Voordat wij kunnen gaan praten over het uitbreiden van klassen
is het zaak om de school eerst te zuiveren
en de leerlingen te plaatsen
Op een school waar zij thuis horen Nu op het ogenblik is het ZO dat als
men het toelatingsexamen doet voor de eerste klas dan zit men op de
lebeS men kan een paar keer blijven zitten en dan blijft men daar hangen
op de hebs Pas in de derde klas of na de derde klas vindt er splitsing
plaats naar A en B Deze sang van zaken
ie ongezond Wanneer men onder
een Sezonde groei verstaat dat de hbs ieder Jaar moet worden uitgebreid
met het aantal leeslingen dat naer de hebs wil en dat geslaagd is voor
het toelatingsexamen eersteklas dan voorzie ik een heel groot probleem
mijne heren ik voorzie een hebs
zo vol als een bijenkorf Het gaat
er namelijk niet om dat wij voor volgend jaar een vierde eerste klas
krijgen Een vierde eerste klas betekent ook een vierde tweede klas te
zijner tijd een vierde derde klas een vierde vierde klas en een vierde
vijfde klas
Wij spreken hier niet over een vierde eerste klas wij Spreken hier over
vijf extra klassen En dit is niet tot uiting gekomen in deze bespreking
Is het Uw bedoeling wanneer U Spreekt van een gezonde groei dat er
leder jaar die maatregelen genomen worden dat er een eerste klas bijkomt
waardoor op den duur er vijf klassen bijkomen denkt U werkelijk dat
Aruba dat kan volhouden Mijne heren het wordt tijd det de Raad en de
hele Arubaanse geneenschap zich realiseert dat Wij financieel niet in
staat zijn alles te doen dat Wij graag zouden willen doen Wij moetende tering naar de nering stellen Men is zich niet voldoende bewust van
A
de financile positie van het Bilandgebied Aruba alhoewel het Bes tuurs
college de laatste Jaren bij de aanbiedingsbrief Pt de begroting er
steeds op heeft Sewezen
dat het financieel vast zou lopen en dat de
Lef
onderwijskosten op den duur niet meer Zijn te financieren Het Bestuurs
college heeft sinds Jaren voorspelt dat de begroting niet zal sluiten
omdat de onderwijskosten zodanig stijgen en de ontvangsten geen gelijke
tred mee houden zodat dit niet bij te houden is Waarschijnlijk heeft
men zich laten misleiden door het feit dat het gelukt is in de afgelopen
jaren om de begroting toch sluitend te maken hoewel het Bestuurscollege
er steeds op gewezen heeft dat git slechts is gelukt in de laatste jaren
door te putten uit de reservefondsen Het Bestuurscollege heeft er ook
op gewezen dat deze fondsen dreigen op te raken In kan U mededelen
dat
de gedeputeerde ook reeds gesteld heeft dat het volgend jaar de kosten
die gebonden zijn aan net onderwijs zullen stijgen met gulden
niet meegerekend de kapitaalsuitgaven Aus niet meegerekend nieuwbouw
en ook niet meegerekend de exploitatieckosten voor de EBGsscholen die
het volgend jaar gebouwd zullen worden Gelijk daarmee zijn de sociale
voorzieningen vanwege de werkloosheid
op het eiland zodanig gestegen
dat voor het volgend jaar ik kan U jat nu reeds mededelen de begroting
van Aruba een tekort zal hebben van miljoen gulden Niet alleen de
stijging van de kosten baart ons zorgen vij hebben herhaaldelijk hierop
gewezen maar ook het feit dat de ontvangsten achterblijven
Om U een idee te geven de opbrengst van inkomstenbelasting voor watbetreft de Lago werknemers is als gevolg van het layoff programma gedaald
als volgt In kreeg net eilandgebied Aruba aan inkonstenbelasting
van lagowerkmemers miljoen gulden Voor is te verwachten el
miljoen gulden Dus in jaar tijd is deze opbrengst deze inkoms tenbe
lastinepost gedaald van miljoen tot l miljoen dus met ruim
miljoen gulden terwijl de onkosten onder anderen van onderwijs stijgen
met sprongen van gulden Het gaat mij niet om deze vierde eerste
klas waar wij het nu over hebben en daarom heb ik niet eerder vanavond
gesproken omdat ik de beslissing van de vierde eerste klas niet wilde
beinvloeden Wanneer ik het woord hier voer nu aan het eind is het alleen
maar om een waarschuwend geluid te laten horen omdat ik vrees dat mens
niet alleen de Raad maar ook buiten de Raad zich niet voldoende bewust
is van de ernst van de situatie
Wanneer bijvoorbeeld een van de lokale kranten een vergelijking trekt
dat als er geld is om nieuwe autos aan te kopen dat er dan ook geld is
om een vierde eerste klas dan raakt een dergelijke vergelijking niet
alleen kant noch wal maar naar nijn gevoel verzaakt hier dan ook de pers
in zijn taak die toch verder gaat dan het plaatsen van advertenties
maar ook een taak heeft tot het voorlichten van de gemeenschape
Het aanschaffen van vier autos is een eenmalige uitgave die plaats
windt om de autos die afgekeurd zijn te vervangen omdat het bedrijfs
eeonomisch goedkoper is om nieuwe autos te kopen dan met oude autos
te blijven rijden Het uitbreiden van een eerste klas hbs
echter brengt
met zieh mee op den duur het uitbreiden met vijf hbseklassen
Ik heb
nelemaal geen bezwaar dat men kritiek heeft op het beleid
van het Bestuurs
college Het is een democratisch
recht en wij houden ons daar zelfs voor
aanbevolen Het zou wel zaak zijn dat deze kritiek of dergelijke verge
lijkingen gegrond waren en niet zo naf Het zou ook prettig zijn als de
pers zou meewerken aan een goede voorlichting zodat niet alleen de Raad
maar ook de gemeeschap zich bewust is van de stand van zaken
Het is absoluut uitgesloten dat het Bilandgebied Aruba jeder jaar het
aantal lokalen erbij voegt voor het onderwijs
en ik spreek niet alleen voor
de hebes naar gelang het aantal leerlingen dat zich daarvoor meldt
Dat is financieel uitgesloten Het Bestuurscollege
en dit zal duidelijk
blijken in de aanbiedingsbrief van de begroting heeft dit van te
voren aangekondigd en zoals U zult merken uit de begroting de Regering
benaderd over de stappen die genomen zuklen worden
Het is ten enen male
duidelijk dat de huidige financile regeling zodanig
te dat heu eilandgebied de onderwijskosten niet kan blijven dragen
Ben mogelijke oplossing
is gat van landswege het onderwijs hetzij geheel
hetzij gedeeltelijk wordt gesubsidieerd zoals ook in Nederland het
z
Rijk de gemeentes financieel steunt in de onderwijskosten
Len andere
mogelijkheid is dat de belastingverdeling wordt herzien waarbij echter
de vraag rijst hoe dan de landsregering het tekort zal dekken
Een andere mogelijkheid is dat de schoolgebouwen dus de faciliteiten
die gebouwd zijn intensiever worden aangewend Vele scholen bijvoor
beeld bij het lager onderwijs worden maar uur per week gebruikt dus
bij de lagere school is het ongeveer uur per week Daarvoor staan er
voor miljoenen aan schoolgebouwen en inrichting Bij de hebse
is het
geloof ik klokuren gemiddeld per week Wij zouden een belangrijke
besparing kunnen bereiken ten aanzien van de nieuwbouw dus de facili
teiten indien deze faciliteiten beter en meer intensief kunnen worden
aangewend door bijvoorbeeld deze scholen niet alleen
s ochtends maar
ook smiddags intensiever te gebruiken gedurende de hele week
Met andere woorden wij zouden het dubbel aantal leerlingen kunnen
plaatsen met de huidige faciliteiten indien wij de scholen niet
uur maar uur per week zouden gebruiken hetgeen mogelijk is
Uiteraard brengt het wel uitbreiding van personeel met zich mee maar
toch zal dit een bezuiniging wezen tenaaanzien van de exploitatie
kosten van de gebouwen Ook hiervoor zal het Bestuurscollege zich wenden
tot de Regering want hiervoor is de medewerking nodig van de Inspectie
van Onderwijs voor de herziening van de lesroosters
Zoals de gedeputeerde naar voren bracht
is het niet alleen een kwestie
van lokalen
en niet ralleen een kwestie van financin zoals ik naar
voren heb gebracht maar ook het feit dat er een groot probleem bestaat
om bevoelde leerkrachten aan te trekken Het is dus niet alleen een
probleem voor Aruba het is een algemeen probleem in de Antillen en
zelfs in Nederland De gedeputeerde vermeldde reeds dat van de
leraren op de hbes
er slechts
bevoegd zijn Onder deze bevoegde
leraren bij de hebs vallen ook de leraar handwerken lichamelijke
oefening en muziek
U kunt wel aan de gang blijven met lokalen bij te
plakken en leerlingen er in te plaatsen maar ik geloof
dat het veel
belangrijker
en veel urgenter is om het peil van het korps van leraren
bij de hbes hoger te brengen en dus een groter aantal bevoegde leraren
te vinden
Ik heb dit slechts naar voren gebracht mijne heren omdat
ik de indruk kreeg
dat men algemeen de mening is toegedaan
dat de ge
zonde groei van de hebes moet zijns ieder jaar een eerste klas erbij
omdat er Leerlingen gijn dive naat dehbs wiilenAls het dat is hetgeen U verstaat onder een gezonde groei dan en
alleen dan wil ik een waarschuwend geluid laten horen Dit zal financieel
absoluut uitgesloten zijn U zal eens het ho moeten zeggen llisschien
is het niet dit jaar dan is het het volgend jaar
Volgens mij hadden wij vorig jaar al ho moeten zeggen Dit geldt uiters
aard niet alleen voor de hebes Dit geldt ook voor andere onderwijs
richtingen Over het idee van een mms heeft de gedeputeerde al naar
voren gebracht dat er een veel betere opleiding is dan de mms
namelijk de heavoopleiding omdat op de havoopleiding zowel de
jongens als de meisjes terecht kunnen die op de hbs niet thuis horen
Dus wij denken in de richting van de heaveoopleiding maar ook dit is
slechts mogelijk indien de financiele regeling voor het onderwijs op
een bevredigende wijze wordt opgelost
Ik wil hier nog aan toevoegen dat
zelfs cadeaux zoals van de EBGescholen die ons cadeau worden gedaan
met de inrichting door ons niet meer zullen kunnen worden aanvaard indien
wij geen financile dekking hebben over de exploitatiekosteneHet is slchts in dit licht dat U het beleid van het Bestuurscollege
noet ZieneIk kan de heer Finck nog mededelen
dat de beslissing
van het Bestuurs
college inderdaad zo was dat besloten werd om niet over te gaan tot de
uitbreiding van een vierde eerste klas Pas nadat deze beslissing genomen
was werd onder de aandacht van het Bestuurscollege gebracht dat de
leerlingen
reeds deze brief waar wij het vandaag over gehad hebben
hadden ontvangen Dit was twee weken voor de aanvang van het schooljaar
Onder onze aandacht werd gebracht dat vele leerlingen reeds hun boeken
hadden aangeschaft Het is slechts om die redenen
dat het Bestuurscollege
toen alsnog gezegd heef tslaten wij deze leerlingen nog een kans
geven
te meer ook omdat onder deze leerlingen voor de eerste klassen zich
ook leerlingen bevinden die reeds gedoubleerd hadden Het is dus zeer
wel mogelijk dat bij het kerstrapport blijkt dat er een aantal leer
lingen zijn die echt niet in aanmerking komen om op de hbes
te blijven
en die ook in hun eigen belang beter bijtijds naar een ander school
kunnen gaan Dat is de enige bedoeling van het Bestuurscollege geweest om
even de zaak aan te kijken bij het kerstrapport en dan te zien
of het nog
nodig en verantwoord is om met een vierde eerste klas te komen Daarom zou
ik dus dit willen stellen dat het voorstel dat hier is ingediend voor
het Bestuurscollege aanvaardbaar is omdat het voorstel zodanig gesteld
is dat het het Bestuurscollege verzoekt om alle maatregelen te treffen
die mogelijk zijn opdat de vier eerste klassen van de hbs worden ge
handhaafd en dat het Bestuurscollege alles in het werk stelt om de
normale groei van de hebs
te bevorderen Wij zijn er in principe hele
maal mee eens
en wij zouden U echter willen verzoeken ons in de gelegen
heid te stellen om te wachten tot het kerstrapport Blijkt dan dat het
niet anders kan dan kunt U er op rekenen dat het Bestuurscollege alle
begrip heeft voor het beleid van de Eilandsraad
en dat wij ook rekening
zullen houden met het beleid van de Eilandsraad Hiermee wilde ik reageren
op enkele vragen die naar voren zijn gebracht Zijn er nog leden die

Vertaling
Mijnheer de Voorzitter het is onze bedoeling vanavond naar huis te gaan
met de verzekering
dat het Bestuurscollege de vierde eerste klas van de
hbse
zal handhaven voor het komende schooljaar Dat is onze bedoeling
meen ik en ook de bedoeling van mijn collegas in deze zaal Wij willen
de verzekering hebben vanavond dat het Bestuurscollege de vierde eerste
klas van de hebese zal toelaten voorAls wij nu weggaan na gezegd te hebben dat wij in december wel zullen
zien den zullen er vele moeilijkheden komen want de onderwijzers zullen
zeggen wie slaagt en wie niet slaagt en met al dat gedoe kan de zaak heel
verward worden En als wij nu aannemen
dat de situatie aldaar gehandhaafd
wordt dan gaan wij allemaal voorlopig naar huis gaan met een tevreden ge
voel Dat is het idee om de ouders gerust te stellen Mijnheer de Voore
zitter U hebt gezegd dat deze kinderen naar een andere school kunnen
gaan Deze kinderen kunnen nergens meer gaan Het schooljaar is al be
gonnen en het is uiterd moeilijk voor de een of andere school om deze
kinderen terug te nemen omdat al de scholen vol zijn Hier is er geen
gebrek aan plaats Er is genoeg plaats op de hebs Ik meen dat het ook
niet gebrek aan onderwijzers is Het Bestuurscollege moet alleen maar
toe
laten dat de vierde eerste klas van de hbs gedurende de volgende
acht maanden gehandhaafd wordt Ik dank UDE VOORZITTER Mijnheer Figaroa realiseert U zich dat als U een dergelijke
beslissing neemt dat die ook een extra tweede klas volgend jaar betekent
Als U A zeet moet
UB zeggen
DE HEER PDFIGAROA Mijnheer de Voorzitter dat hoeft niet want zoals
U gezeed hebt kan er het volgend jaar een strengere selectie toegepast
worden
DE VOORZITTER Bent U daar dan wel voor
DE HEER FDFIGAROA Dat heb ik toch gezegd Mijnheer de Voorzitter
DE VOORZITTER Dus U bent wel tegen uitbreiding van nog een tweede klas
het volgend jaar
DE HEER FDFIGAROA
Ik ben niet tegen uitbreiding Mijnheer de Voorzitter
Ik heb gezegd dat wij deze kinderen de kans zullen moeten geven Wij
geven hen geen eerlijke kans als wij van nu af besluiten om met ingang van
l december te kijken wie daar toegelaten kunnen worden aangezien deze
kinderen reeds zijn toegelaten tot een hbese
DE VOORZITTERsMijnheer Figaroa ik vrees dat U aan struisvogelpolitiek
doete
DE HEER LA ICHANCE Mijnheer de Voorzitter k wil duidelijk weten vat
het Bestuurscollege bedoelt wanneer zij zegt dat het voorstel aanvaarde
paar is Bedoelt U dat het voorstel aanvaard is Gaarne zal ik Uw antwoord
daarop willen vernemen
DE VOORZITTER Ik ben heel duidelijk geweest Mijnheer Chance Ik heb ge
zegd dat het verzoek aanvaardbaar is omdat het voorstel zodanig gesteld
is dat het het Bestuurscollege verzoekt En dat het Bestuurscollege bereid
is het verzoek in beraad te nemen doeh wij
zullen een eindbeslissing
willen nemen in december wanneer blijkt of het inderdaad onvermijdelijk
is om uit te breiden met een vierde eerste klas Het kan namelijk best
zo wezen dat het niet nodig is
DE HEER LALCHANCH Mijnheer de Voorzitter dan handhaaf ik mijn voorstel
dat ik aan de Raad gedaan heb dat wij hier vanavond een beslissing nemen
dat deze vierde eerste klas van de hbs gehandhaafd wordtDE HEER JGEERMAN Mijnheer de Voorzitter met veel belangstelling
heb ik
geluisterd naar Uw betoog Het is inderdaad zo dat de financile situatie
van het Eilandgebied Aruba niet rooskleurig is Dat hebben wij ook ver
wacht laar de kwestie van de hbs
is een heel andere kwestie Mijnheer
de Voorzitter Wij hebben reeds de kinderen daar toegelaten en ik denk dat
het Bestuurscollege ook eonsequent moet zijn en er zorg voor moet dragen
dat de kinderen ook rustig hun onderwijs kunnen volgen en dat er geen
enkele soort van belemmering in de weg wordt gezet om de bloei van de
hebese te verstoren Mijnheer de Voorzitter de heer Chance heeft een
voorstel gedaan en ik ondersteun zijn voorstel Als wij vanavond hier
weggaan en wij weten niet waar wij aan toe zijn U heeft zojuist terecht
gezegd dn spelen wij struisvogelpolitiek hier in de Raad
Mijnheer de Voorzitter
ik denk niet dat een volksvertegenwoordiger ge
roepen is om van deze plaats struisvogelpolitiek te spelen Wij hebben
een eed afgelegd in die zin zoals mijn geachte collega Dominico GCroes
het naar voren heeft gebracht
Mijnheer de Voorzitter ik denk dat iedereen in deze Raad vanavond rustig
et SLAPEN saerensers
VOORZITTER Mijnheer Geerman er zijn al twee rondatgeweest U hebt
ruimschoots de kans gehad
Ik verzoek U zich te beperken tot het voorstel
van de heren Werleman Croes
en Figaroa en om het kort te maken
DE HEER JGEERMANs Zeker Mijnheer de Voorzitter
Ik ben niet eens met het
voorstel en ik steun het voorstel van de heer Chance
Ik dank U Mijnheer
de Voorzitter
DE HEER DGCROES Mijnheer de Voorzitter ik stel voor het voorstel
van
de indieners zodanig te wijzigen dat het voorstel van de heer Chance in
wordt opsenomen
DE VOORGTPTER Het voorstel van de heer Chance gaat verder dan het inge
diende voorstel
Het ingediende voorstel verzoekt en de heer Chance stelt
voor dat de Raad niet het Bestuurscollege verzoekt maar de heer Chance
stelt voor dat de Raad beslist
Zijn de indieners bereid hun voorstel te herzien conform het voorstel
van de heer Chance Zo niet dan zal ik het voorstel van de heer Chance in
stemmine moeten brengen want het voorstel van de heer Chance gaat verder
dan het voorstel van de indieners
DE HEER AVERLEMANs Mijnheer de Voorzitter wij zijn bereid dit voorstel
te wijzigen zoals het door de heer Chance is geamendeerd
DE VOORZITTER Wenst iemand hoofdelijke stemming
DE HEER LeAICHANCE
Ja Mijnheer de Voorzitter
ik zou graag willen dat
ene
AE
mijn voorstel in stemming wordt gebrachte
DE HEER UCRONS Mijnheer de Voorzitter welk voorstel wordt in stemming
gebracht het voorstel van de heer Chance of het voorstel van ons als
indieners
DE VOORZITER Het voorstel zoals ingediend door de heren Max Croes Frans
Figaroa en Werleman zoals geamendeerd op voorstel van de heer Chancee
Dat betekent dus dat de Raad niet verzoekt maar de Raad beslist tot het
handhaven van een vierde eerste klas bij de hbs voor het schooljaarGaan de indieners akkoord met deze interpretatie Zo ja dan gaan wij over
tot hoofdelijke stemmingDE HEER IS DE CUBA Mijnheer de Voorzitter mag ik mijn stem motiveren
Mijnheer de Voorzitter het is niet de bedoeling om tegen de vierde eerste
klas te stemmen daar door U als Voorzitter van het Bestuurscollege uitleg
is gegeven dat het Bestuurscollege toch na l december haar best zal doen
om de vierde eerste klas te handhaven
Ik stem tegen het voorstel van de
heer Chance

Vertaling Mijnheer de Voorzitter sta me toe mijn stem te motiveren
Ik zal nooit en te nimmer iemand van de buitendistrikten zijnde kunnen
ontkennen

buitendistrikten vandaag zo ver gevorderd zou zijn daarom steun ik het

INTRODUCCION
Linguistica ta e ciencia cu ta studia idioma den tur su aspectonan y
gramatica ta forma parti esencial di e ciencia aki
Gramatica ta studia sistema di lenga E papiadonan di un lenga
ta agrupa palabra segun nan forma nan funcion y nan nificacion
Ademas ta existi regla pa combina nan y forma frase coherente
Por defini gramatica anto como e parti di linguistica cu ta studia
e conhunto di regla cu un idioma tin pa forma palabra combina
nan y uza nan den construccion di frase E partinan fundamental di
gramatica ta morfologia y sintaxis Algun investigado ta inclui tambe
fonetica y fonologia y semantica
Morfologia ta e estudio cu ta ocupa su mes cu structura formacion
funcion y nificacion di palabra di un lenga
Por ehempel apreciabel ta deriva di e verbo aprecia a pone e
sufiho be su tras pa forma un adhetivo
e muchanan ta feliz e sustantivo mucha ta haya e
sufiho nan pa forma plural
Sintaxis ta studia con ta ordena coordina y subordina e palabranan
y e relacionnan cu e palabranan aki tin den frase
Por ehempel E ruman di Frans ta skirbi poema
Suheto E ruman di Frans
Predicado ta skirbi
Obheto directo poema

KICO TA PALABRAIntroduccion
Por defini palabra como e unidad linguistico minimo cu forma y
nificacion propio cu por aparece independientemente den un frase
Por demostra independencia di palabra door di cambia nan di luga
den un frase despasa y door di separa nan for di otro
Asina por ehempel den e frase E pushi ta bebe lechi nos por cambia
e luga di echi bisando Lechi e pushi ta bebe Nos por separa echi for
di bebe poniendo hopi su dilanti E pushi ta bebe hopi lechi Di e forma
ey nos por isola palabra
Sinembargo desplasamento y separacion di palabra ta someti na
cierto limitacion cu ta depende di e reglanan gramatical di un idioma
Asina por ehempel nos ta ripara cu semper den Papiamento e ta
aparece dilanti di pushi of di lechi of di cualke palabra cu ta cay bou di
e mesun categoria cu pushi y lechi Ademas e e ey ta aparece semper
hunto cu e categoria di palabra ey y nunca e no por aparece su so
den e funcion eyCategoria di palabra
A base di e forma y e nificacion di e palabranan di e uzo cu e
papiadonan di un lenga ta haci di e palabranan di e lenga ey den frase
y di e caracteristicanan comun cu e palabranan tin ta parti palabra
den diferente categoria esta ta categorisa palabra
E totalidad
di palabra di un lenga yama vocabulario of lexico
Generalmente ta haya un gran parti di e lexico of vocabulario di un
lenga den diccionario of den lista di palabra cu sa yama vocabulario
tambe
Tradicionalmente ta incorpora e palabranan di un lenga den e dies
categorianan menciona den e introduccion Fuera di esey ta parti
mayoria di categoria di palabra den subcategoria manera por nota
na diferente capitulo
Tin forma di palabra cu ta cay bou di diferente categoria Asina por
ehempel e palabra pea dependiendo di e uzo cu e papiadonan di
nos lenga haci di dje por ta sustantivo den Ayera mi a cumpra un
pea y verbo den Elvis a caba di pea su cabey
Palabra cu tin e mesun forma y cu ta zona mescos pero cutin nificacion
totalmente diferente yama homonimo por ehempel santo persona
yen di virtud honra cu e titulo ey pa Iglesia y substancia cu ta consisti
di pipita masha masha fini y chikito di piedra E relacion entre e forma
di palabra y e nificacionnan diferente yama homonimia
Ora dos of mas palabra tin e mesun nificacion nos ta papia di sinonimia
e palabranan ta sinonimo di otro por ehempel muca traha y labora
muca ta un forma arcaico traha ta esun mas comun y general y labora
ta un forma modernoMorfologia di palabra
Morfologia ta describi e structura gramatical interno di palabra Pa
loke ta e structura interno di palabra nos por parti palabra den palabra
simpel y palabra combina
Palabra simpel ta tur palabra cu tin un forma propio basico cu no
a haya ningun elemento acerca pa haya nificacion e ta un unidad
di forma y nificacion cu no por analisa mas aleu den elemento di
nificacion por ehempel awa
Palabra combina ta tur palabra cu ta consisti di un forma basico na
cual a agrega otro elementonan pa haya nificacion por sigui analisa
nan mas aleu
E palabranan comemento y comedo por ehempel ta palabra combina
por sigui analisa nan den e partinan come mento y come do
mento ta indica e ehecucion di e accion cu e verbo come ta expresa
y do ta indica e persona of animal cu ta ehecuta e accion cu e verbo
come ta expresa
Cada un di e elementonan di forma cu no por analisa mas aleu come
mento y do yama morfema Cada morfema ta e elemento gramatical
minimo cu tin nificacion Den e caso di palabra simpel e conceptonan di
morfema y di palabra ta coincidi manera ta e caso di e verbo come

Tin dos sorto di palabra combina palabra deriva y palabra componi
Palabra deriva ta palabra manera comemento y comedo menciona
akiriba Nan ta forma a base di un palabra basico come y un otro
forma mento do E proceso di derivacion di palabra ta sosode a
base di pegamento di un prefiho of un sufiho na e palabra basico E
prefiho ta e forma cu ta pega dilanti di e palabra basico y e sufiho tae
forma cu ta pega patras di e palabra basico manera den comemento
y comedo
Ehempel di palabra deriva a base di prefiho ta contraresta prehuicio
antidemocratico ilegal descomposicion propone etc Otro ehempel
di palabra deriva a base di sufiho ta egalisa husgamento movecion
decision democraticamente Arubano Hulandes etc
Tin palabra deriva forma cu tanto prefiho como sufiho por ehempel
subcategorisa Y den subcategorisacion tin te hasta dos sufiho
Palabra componi ta palabra cu tin un solo forma y un solo nificacion
pero cu ta forma pa dos of mas palabra basico por ehempel palo di uz
of pal luz forma pa tres palabra basico palo di y luz Otro ehempel
di palabra componi ta panboyo pandushi pegasaya compolaga
lembelansa bay over tuma parti sinonimo di participa etc
Tanto e proceso di derivacion como esun dicomposicion ta pertenece
na e proceso amplio di formacion di palabra den un lenga

caracteristicananFor di punto di bista fonologico un enunciado ta un cadena di
zonido limita pa pausa y pronuncia cu melodia y entonacion

Diferencia
E diferencia grandi entre obheto preposicional y obheto directo ta cu
e obheto preposicional semper ta wordo introduci pa un preposicion
mientras cu e obheto directo no por tin nunca ningun complemento

Otro diferencia grandi entre obheto preposicional y obheto directo

cu comportacion di e publico mientras cu obheto directo no por
aparece hamas den frase cu predicado nominalDiferencia entre obheto preposicional y complemento
adverbial
Tin biaha ta dificil pa distingui un obheto preposicional for di un
complemento adverbial cu ta aparece introduci pa un preposicion
E diferencia ta cu e preposicion cu un obheto preposicional ta
cuminsa cu ne ta un preposicion fiho no por reemplase mientras
cu e preposicion cu un complemento adverbial ta cuminsa cu ne ta
variabel por reemplaseEla profundisa su mes den e buki den avionSemper nos ta tene cuenta cu otro hendeSemper e ta warda su yiu den cura di scol
Den caso di frase den e buki ta obheto preposicional e verbo
profundisa bo mes semper ta compaa pa e preposicion fiho den
profundisa bo mes den algo no por reemplase mientras cu
den avion ta complemento adverbial di luga por reemplase por
ehempel pa den auto na cas canti awa etc
Den caso di frase cu otro hende ta claramente obheto
preposicional pa motibo cu semper e preposicion fiho cu ta
compaa e expresion fene cuenta no por reemplase
Pero den caso di frase den cura di scol ta claramente un
complemento adverbial di luga por reemplase por ehempel pa
den auto pafo di scol paribi scol etc
Den caso di duda entre obheto preposicional y complemento
adverbial ta e nificacion di e verbo den su relacion cu e preposicion
ta determina kico ta e caso Den caso di obheto preposicional e
preposicion semper ta mara na e verbo preposicion fiho Den caso
di un complemento adverbial cu ta cuminsa cu un preposicion e
preposicion no ta mara na e verbo sino na loke ta siguiPredicado cu obheto preposicional verbo cu
preposicion fiho
Obheto preposicional por aparece cu predicado verbal y cu

Den gramatica ta distingui dos tipo di structura di tempo den frase
structura di tempo interno y structura di tempo externo E termino
cu ta denota e structura di tempo interno ta aspecto y e termino cu
ta uza pa e structura di tempo externo ta tempo Aspecto ta seala
e manera cu e papiado ta concebi realisacion di loke e verbo uza
como nucleo di e predicado ta expresa esta e eventualidad
Mira tambe Manual di Gramatica di Papiamento Morfologia
Tempo y Aspecto y den e buki aki PredicadoClasificacion
Generalmente ta distingui dos clase di aspecto
aspecto lexical y
aspecto gramatical
Aspecto lexical ta e aspecto cu por deduci a base di e nificacion di e
verbo uza como nucleo di e predicado cu of sin ayudo di otro parti di
fraseMaria a come un tayo di sopiE bom a rementa den centro di ciudad
E verbonan come y rementa tin un aspecto cu por deduci di nan
nificacion E verbo come tin un sentido di duracion cu ta tuma tempo
pa wordo realisa E verbo rementa al contrario tin un sentido di
duracion casi inexistente Den e casonan aki ta trata di aspecto lexical
Aspecto gramatical ta e aspecto di un accion proceso of estado
expresa den un frase cu no por deduci di e verbo mes sino a base
di otro elemento gramatical den e fraseSelvia a lesa un buki ayera perfectivoSelvia tabata lesa un buki ayera imperfectivo
E diferencia entre e dos ehempelnan aki ta a base di e particulanan
a y tabata Ambos particula ta denota tempo pasado E diferencia
entre e particulanan aki ta sinta den e aspecto cu nan ta denota
a ta denota tempo pasado pero e aspecto ta perfectivo mientras
cu fabata tambe ta denota tempo pasado pero e aspecto ta
imperfectivo Den e caso aki ta trata di aspecto gramatical
Mira Aspecto perfectivo y aspecto imperfectivoAspecto lexical
Na a compara e verbonan come y rementa pa ilustra e aspecto
lexical E verbonan riba nan mes ta duna un idea di e aspecto di e
eventualidad esta e accion e proceso of e estado
Ta categorisa aspecto lexical a base di e tres caracteristicanan di e
eventualidad cualnan ta duracion si e eventualidad tin un lapso di
tempo dinamismo si e eventualidad tin diferente fase y limite si e
eventualidad tin un punto final
Tumando na cuenta presencia of ausencia di duracion dinamismo
y limite por distingui cuatro tipo di aspecto lexical estado actividad
realisacion y logro

Nota
Mester enfatisa cu e terminonan uza pa e cuater aspectonan lexical
estado actividad realisacion y logro ta termino gramatical cu por
desvia den nificacion di e palabranan comun estado actividad
realisacion y logro cu ta uza den combersacion di tur diaEstado
Estado ta e aspecto lexical den cua e eventualidad tin duracion
pero tanto dinamismo como limite ta ausente Aunke estado por
transcuri durante un lapso di tempo e eventualidad no tin diferente
fase cu ta tuma luga tras di otro dinamismo ni tampoco por bisa cu
e estado lo stop di existi limite E verbo copulativo fa y e verbonan
independiente sa y stima ta ehempel di e aspecto lexical estadoLuisa ta maloPedro sa FrancesGina ta stima su ylunan
Nota
Por distingui un caracter temporal of permanente di un estado
pero no por deduci esaki for di e verbo mes sino a base di e
caracteristica di otro elemento gramatical den e fraseLuisa ta malo temporalManolo ta sabi permanente
Den e prome frase segun e contexto por tin e expectativa cu Luisa
lo recobra su salud den futuro ya cu e adhetivo malo ora ta referi
na estado di salud ta algo cu por cambia pues malo den e caso
aki tin un sentido temporal Den e di dos frase por tuma como echo
cu e sabiduria di Manolo lo no cambia Sabi como adhetivo tin un
sentido di no ta cambia den transcurso di tempo e tin un sentido
permanente Sinembargo ta logico cu un malesa frase por ta
permanente cronico tambe pero no ta algo normalActividad
Actividad ta e aspecto lexical den cua e eventualidad tin duracion
y tambe dinamismo pero e no tin limite Por subdividi un actividad
den actividad mas chikito cu e verbo ta expresa como un totalidad E
verbo come cu a uza den e introduccion di e capitulo aki ta ehempel
di e aspecto lexical aki Otro verbo ta entre otro baila pinta y corePatricia ta baila bonE mucha ta pinta auto riba e blachiE cabritonan ta core den cunucu
E verbonan baila pinta y core riba nan mes ta denota duracion sin
cu implicitamente nan ta expresa un momento di terminacionRealisacion
Realisacion mescos cu actividad ta e aspecto lexical den cua e
eventualidad tin duracion y tambe dinamismo pero den caso di
realisacion por deduci cu tin limite Dado momento e eventualidad
lo yega na un punto finalManuela ta canta e himno di CorsouE mucha ta pinta un auto riba e blachiEvelina a traha un dushi sopi di pisca
Den e ehempelnan e parti cu letter Italico ta e verbo y e parti subraya
ta e obheto directo E verbonan cu riba nan mes ta denota un actividad
sin limite ta haya un limite pa medio di un obheto directo specifico
Tin un distincion di aspecto lexical pa loke ta trata e frasenan akiE mucha ta pinta auto riba e blachi actividadE mucha ta pinta un auto riba e blachi realisacion
Den e prome frase e suheto ta ehecuta un accion pinta auto cu
no tin un punto final explicito Si un maestro den un klas duna e

instruccion na un alumno pa e pinta auto e alumno lo cuminsa pinta
pero e eventualidad no tin un punto final explicito Asina cu e mucha
pinta un auto e por cuminsa pinta un otro y despues un otro y un
otro etc Si e maestro duna e instruccion pa pinta un auto e alumno
ta ehecuta un accion pero asina e completa e dibuho di e auto e
accion ta termina E diferencia entre ambos frase ta cu e obheto
directo auto den e di dos frase ta specifica pa medio di e articulo
indefini unLogro
Logro ta e aspecto lexical den cua asina cu e eventualidad tuma
luga practicamente e ta yega su punto final of limite Aunke por
tin duracion toch esaki ta asina cortico cu tin e impresion cu e ta
inexistente A pesar cu duracion ta ausente logro tin dinamismo o
sea algo ta sosodeFrancisco a haya cincuenta florin abouE bom a rementa den centro di ciudadDiripiente el a corda cu el a laga e stoof cendiAspecto gramatical
Contrario na aspecto lexical caminda por deduci e tipo di aspecto a
base di e nificacion di e verbo riba su mes of acompaa pa un otro
elemento gramatical manera un obheto directo por deduci aspecto
gramatical solamente a base di otro elemento gramatical den frase
Esakinan por ta particula verbo auxiliar construccion verbal y
of construccion adverbial Tin diferente tipo di aspecto gramatical
pero e dos aspectonan basico ta aspecto perfectivo y aspecto
imperfectivoAspecto perfectivo y aspecto imperfectivo
Den caso di aspecto perfectivo y aspecto imperfectivo e perspectiva
di e papiado ta di mira e eventualidad den su totalidad Aspecto
perfectivo ta e aspecto cu ta mustra cu e eventualidad a termina
completamente Aspecto imperfectivo ta e aspecto cu ta mustra cu e
eventualidad ta den desaroyoSelvia a lesa un buki ayera perfectivoSelvia tabata lesa un buki ayera imperfectivo
Ambos frase ta den tempo pasado E aspecto lexical ta un
realisacion lesa un buki Den e prome frase e enfoke ta riba
terminacion di e accion y pa e motibo ey ta trata di aspecto
perfectivo particula a Den e di dos frase e enfoke ta riba desaroyo
di e accion mes lagando afo un eventual culminacion di e accion
Den e caso aki ta trata di aspecto imperfectivo particula tabataOtro aspecto gramatical
Tin mas aspecto gramatical den idioma ademas di aspecto
perfectivo y aspecto imperfectivo Den caso di e otro aspectonan
aki e perspectiva di e papiado ta di mira e eventualidad no den
su totalidad sino den fase No ta tur idioma ta duna mes tanto
importancia na tur aspecto gramatical Aki ta sigui algun aspecto
gramatical adicional y con ta realisa nan
I Aspecto incoativo
Aspecto incoativo ta denota e fase inicial di un eventualidad Por lo
general ta haci uzo di e verbo auxiliar cuminsaEla cuminsa canta manera un paharitoE parlamentario a cuminsa papia duro

Nota
Mientras cu den la ta e particula ta denota e aspecto progresivo

Aspecto habitual ta denota un eventualidad cu ta sosode cu
regularidad Ta haci uzo di e verbo auxiliar sa hunto cu un
construccion adverbial pa indica un eventualidad habitualMi bisia sa laba paa tur diasabraPatricia tabata sa bay lama den weekend

perfectivo y aspecto imperfectivo por yega na e conclusion cu bon
mira aspecto incoativo y su polo opuesto aspecto terminativo ta
variedad di aspecto perfectivo mientras cu aspecto progresivo y
aspecto habitual ta variedad di aspecto imperfectivo
Den caso di aspecto incoativo e verbo auxiliar cuminsa y den caso
di aspecto terminativo e construccionnan verbal stop di y caba di tin
un aspecto perfectivo cu por deduci di nan nificacion Den caso di
aspecto progresivo e verbo independiente den infinitivo of gerundio
y e construccion verbal ta bezig fa y e verbo auxiliar sa hunto cu un
construccion adverbial tin un aspecto imperfectivo cu por deduci di

ous storage rooms The chef will
have at his disposal at all times a
great variety of foods all waiting
for his use when he wants them
Since various kinds of fresh fish

The Aruba Caribbean Hotel has
been designed to create a new con
cept of a West Indian resort hotel
The architects Morris Lapidus Leo
Kornblath Associate who have had
a great deal of experience in resort
hotel design have completed with
in the last three years in Miami
Beach the Fontainebleau the Eden
Roc and the Americana At the
present time they are building a
new hotel on the Island of Jamaica
the Arawak With this large expe
rience in resort hotel design has
been combined a thorough study
of the Island of Aruba itself
Mr Lapidus and Mr Kornblath
have visited our island frequently
during the past two years and have
familiarized themselves with the
Aruban couleur locale and thats
why the Aruba Caribean will have
not only the best features of fine
resort hotels but also many new
features which can only be found
in an unusual site such as the Island
of Aruba
The Aruba Caribbean is located on
a long stretch of the whitest sand
beach to be found any place in the
Caribbean Protected by coral reefs
the Caribbean is always calm and
sparkling blue along these white
sandy beaches The building will
be eight stories high six of these
stories will be devoted to guest
rooms the lower two floors will be
public spaces which include the
lobby cocktail lounge a gaming
casino an unusual circular dining
room a night club a coffee shop
galleries and shopping arcades
There will be shops which will
handle dutyfree merchandise from
all over the world Facing the Ca
ribbean will be an unusual arrange
ment of gardens terraces decks
cabanas entertainment areas and a
raised pool and pool deck
The Hotel will be approached by
new fourlane macadam highway
which comes from the airport and
from our capital Oranjestad along
a sweeping curved drive The visi
tor will drive up to the main en
trance of the Hotel on a flying
roadway which soars clear off the
ground on a
elevated highway
guest in at the upper lobby level
Having once arrived at the entrance
will form cascades and pools in
various parts of the garden to
complete the picture of a truly
tropical paradise There will be an
outdoor circular bar off the pool
deck set in a shaded area to serve
drinks not only during the day but
also at night when the gardens will
be a cool and pleasant place
The dining room will be an unu
sual room for a hotel It is a com
the climate is consistent pleasantly
mild throughout the year there is
no need for doors The lobby it
self is large and interesting It will
be a study in native tile native cut
stone exotic woods and large ex
panses of sliding glass walls to
afford a view in all directions
Furnished in East Indian and West
Indian furnishings the lobby will
introduce the guest into a new type
of Caribbean vacation Three fast
modern elevators will be ready to
take the guest to his own room
Leading from the lobby is a gently
ramped gallery which connects the
upper lobby to the dining room
which is placed at an intermediate
level to give diners a wonderful
view not only of the Caribbean but
of the beach and the unusual pool
deck and garden and terrace com
plex which form the grounds of
the Hotel Off the lobby will be
found the Bali Bar which will be a
salute from the Netherlands An
tilles to the culture of Indonesia
The bar itself will have an unusual
decor in an authentic recapture of
exotic Bali This room will be used
for cocktails and dancing
Off the main lobby will be found
the gaming casino It will be a large
luxurious room combining the bril
liant hues of the Caribbean The
colors will be Caribbean blue West
Indian green and the deep midnight
purple a color found only in this
area Soft lighting from concealed
sources and the best principles of
soundconditioning will make this a
delightful room for games of chance
The lower lobby is in effect a
shopping arcade In this area will
be found all types of merchandise
in interesting shops Arranged like
a miniature shopping center there
will be found barber shop beauty
parlor travel agency newsstand and
individual shops each containing
various types of merchandise col
lected from the four corners of the
earth Since Aruba is a dutyfree
Island and Port guests will be able
to buy merchandise at the same
prices that they would pay if the
merchandise were bought in their
native countries Another feature in
plete circle with a domed ceiling
Half of the circumference of the
room is of glass with a full view
of the ocean the gardens the pool
and the terraces In front of this
part of the dining room will be a
large shaded terrace which will
also be used for outdoor dining The
glass doors separating the dining
room from the terrace can be
opened up to create one large
dining area Unusual woods will be
used to pannel the rest of the walls
in this dining room Lighting fix
tures of gleaming brass and woven
straw will furnish soft and pleasant
illumination at night Vaulted ribs
of wood will carry the domed
ceiling the floor will be of native
tule and the furniture of woven
straw bamboo and rottan
combined to create an atmosphere
of the finest dining in a tropical
setting
The night club will be the one
extremely modern note in the entire
Hotel The room is designed with
prismatically faceted surfaces in
gleaming colors A large circular
raised stage will be used for
dancing as well as for the present
ation of entertainment The room
has a plan which will create an ef
fect of intimate dining and enter
tainment with lighting and sound
engineering usually found in the
finest night clubs The night club
and the dining room are so placed
that the two rooms can be opened
into one to accomodate approxi
mately people at one time
To properly service and feed the
night club the dining room and the
coffee shop as well as to provide
efficient room service
modern kitchen forms a part of this
Hotel On the Island of Aruba the
kitchen and its auxiliary services is
a good deal larger than would be
The guest rooms on the upper
floors are arranged in a most un
usual plan These rooms are not the
usual rectangular hotel room There
is an interesting arrangement of
walls to create a room of form and
ihape which has never been at
tempted in any other hotel Each
room has its own private terrace
and all terraces are so arranged
that there is no visibility from one
to the other Every room has a full
view of the ocean with a glass wall
separating the room from the ter
race Although the rooms are com
pletely airconditioned the guest
may if he wishes throw open the
full wall separating the terrace
from the guest room for a complete
integration of indoors and outdoors
Every room has a dressing room as
well as a bath and each room has
a large walkin closet There will be
suites on every floor for those guests
who wish more than the normal
large guest bedroom Every guest
room will be furnished as a combi
nationbedroomsittingroom
On the roof will be found a com
plete health club for men and women
including solarium for sunbathing
massage room etc
The entire Hotel will be complete
ly airconditioned with the excep
tion of the lower lobby shopping
arcade and the upper lobby which
are left completely open to the
tropical Passaat Trade Winds
All mechanical facilities which
all
cmg
The gardens surrounding the Ho
tel will be typical of Aruba There
will be areas of heavily massed tro
pical foliage in brilliant colors
Other garden areas will combine a
great number of cactus plants some
growing to a tremendous height
all of which are found on the
Island Unusually shaped bould
ers which are found on Aruba will
be gathered to form interesting
boulder gardens with rock and
foliage combined to create an at
mosphere to be found only on this
Island The DiviDivi tree which is
native to the Island of Aruba will
are
found in a firstrate hotel will be
found at the Aruba Caribbean It
will have its own laundry its
valet and all other facilities which
guests expect in a firstrate hotel

hotel in a most attractive part of the
Caribbean will be completed in
