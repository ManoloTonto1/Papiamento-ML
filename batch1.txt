peze week had ik een gesprek me a een jongedame en een jongeman
die dit jaar beiden voor bun mulo diploma zijn geslaagd
het gesprek verliep niet erg bevredigend en ik bleef er na
afloop over peinzen
rgens zo dacht ik zit er lets scheef het toeval vilde
dat een redacteur van bao di kwihi in inijn klas kwam en vroeg
hoe veal jongens zich ophun krant vilden abonneren
een jaar lang al lees ik bao di kwihi met veel plezier en i
ik dacht waarom zou ik deze gesprekken niet navertellen mis
schien heeft iemand van het la salle college of maria college
de moed om comaentaar te geven het probleem is nl nog niet
opgelost eerst de jongeman
meneer ik heb nog geen work ben dit jaar geslaagd en zou
graag nog iets gaan studerenkunt u mij iets adviseren
ik van veachillende kranten heb ik gehoord dat er op aruba
veel gebrek is an mensen die boekhouden hebben gestudeerd
voel je niets voor deze studie
si j sorry meneer dat is nietsvcor mij want ik heb mulo
met wiskunde als ik boekhouden had villen loren was ik er in
de de klas al mao begonnen
ik jammer maar je zou het alsnog kunnen doen
hij boekhouden is voor diegenen die te dom zijn voor wis
kunde niet voor mij maar meneer missohien ga ikvolgend
jaar naar de statesom tochniek te studoren
ilka danzou misachien een cursus engelse conversatie iets
voor jp zijn
hijmaar meneer ik kail toch niet iets gaan loren wat ik
al keni engels heb ik op de mulo al goleerd
ie jongedames i
zij wilde ned handel sc orrespbndentie leren er werd eon boek
gelcocht set lste godeelte bestond uit het maken van thomas
oals voorzetsels invullen van twee hoofdzinnen een samenge
stelde zin maken met behulp van een voegwoord enz
iks je koopt maar een woordenboek en dan begin je opzoeken wat
je hie twee t en themas maken ik corrigeer het work do oefenin
gen vormen een verlengstuk van wat je op de mulo hebt ge leer cl
dus doe je best
zijs moet ik die therna s zomaar maken meneer dat is toch
de omgekeerde were id iiks hoezo je weet toch hoe het moet
zijs maar meneer h moet de therna s eerst maken dan leer
ik ze thuis en dan ken ik ze zo deden we het op school ook
ik heb mover nagedacht en ik doe
het eignnlijk nogik vbaag me ill
waarom iciest iemand mulo met wiskunde als er op aruba veel
gebrek is aan boekhouden
is boekhouden alleen voor de dommen
yjaarom is er zo we ini g animo voor deze studie ik ken honder
den mens en die steno typen conversatie correspondentie ens
leren voor boekhouden ken ik er k tien of elf
kan ik veronderstellen dat iemand met een mulodiploma zelf
standig vender lean studeren of is dit teveel gevraagd
n b de jongemandie al engels kende dat is niet son pro
bleem ik heb hem gevraagd of hij een avond vrij had dan kan
ik er nog wat bijleren je bent er nl nooit te oud voor
mhr engelbaerts
ik was nogal verrast toen een meisje dat tot de redactie
van een schoolkrant bleek te behoren mij vroeg om iets over mijn
leven te schrijven tifet een eer ltt zei ik tteetilijkt wel een beet
je moeilijk maar ja ik zal het proberen dus hier volgt dan het
beloofde stukje
fs morgens werden we afgehaald
het was op een leerfabriek waar ik ter were id kwaui niet
lang daarna dus nog piep jong verd ik met nog enkele kameraadjes
naar aruba gestuurd en kwamen op onze voorlopige verblijfplaats
we konden zelfs niet voldoende uitrusten na die lange rdis want
diekelfde namiddag stonden we in een etalage te pronken
hemeltje lief ik kan me nog goed herinneren hoe eng dat was
a die ogen op je gerichtj en kritiek dat je kreeg te horenf
enfin over smaak valt niet te twisten
daar ik niet graag te lang in de hete zon wilde blijven en
ook niet met een paar centimeters stof wilde bedekt worden
gedroeg ik me als iemand van prima kwaliteit
en warempel nog de andere morgen kreeg ik een bazin
maar eerst werd ik van alle kanten bekeken en nog eens bekeken
totdat ja de beslissing viel op mij j fwat een gelukl m
dacht ik doch later bleek dat ik ongelijk had
de eerste september maakte ik kennis met nieuwe vriedjes en
met de school van mijn bazin die eerste weken werd ik ook flink
verwend en ik voelde me ook wat trots en tegen mijn vrindjes
blufte ik dan zeg ik zie d netter uit dan jullie en ik heb
thuis een ere plaats op een tafeltje waar het heerlijk fris ist
dan keken de anderen een beetje sip maar toen kwam het verschrik
kelijke ik ontdekte dat ik niet rneer zo lief werd behandeld en
ik werd een beetje verdrietiglater werd het erger ik werd raaar met boeken en spullen
vol gepropt en dan thuis zomaar in een hoek gegooidals de jonge dame te veel huiswerk kreeg dan kreeg ik de
hele tijd gebrom te horen en als zij weer iets lastigs te leren
kreeg dan kreeg ik er voor op mijn kop als of een arme schooltas
het helpen kan datzij zotn taak opgekregen had i
was ik maar in die winkel gebleveni misschien zou het er
veel leuker zijnl
life ken maanden jaren gingen voorbij en ook aan mijn
eentonigc moeilijk leven kwam een einde maar nu heb ik ein
delijk rust gekregen en breng
mijn laatste dagen door in een o o o o o o go o

we zaten midden in de centrale proefwerken vlk voor de over
gang dagen waaraan geen einde scheen te komen en waarin wij
ons extra flink op de studie toelegden
bet werk was werkelijk fpikantm met het gevolg dat het veel
van ons verstand en van onze zenuwen vergdej
ivlaar eindelijk was alles toch achter de rug de leus af
vachten hielden we haast niet meer uit de spanning steeg met
de dag en de barometer van het maria college stond op barsten
men werd cm een kleinigheidje afgesnauwd door de hyperner
veuze klas of iiever gezegd lotgenootjes kon er niet eens meer
een vriendelijk woord vanaf  meenj t
gelukkig begrepen we elkaar volkomen zodat er geen kinderachtige
ruzie t je s ont st onde n
maar later werd de spanning oogevoerd tot hoogs panning
dat was de middag waarop de ouders het rapport in ontvangst zou
den komen nemen
mijn huisgenoten plaagden mij het arme zusje ombarmfeartig
zodat ik mijn toevlucht in mijn kamer ocht maar lang kon ik het
hier niet uithouden dus besloot ik mijn ouders tegemoet te gaan
achter mij hoorde ik spottende uitroepen van de kleintjes en ik
verdacht mijn grote plaagzieke broer er sterk van dat hij ze
aanzette cm me van ale s na te schreeuwen
ha dat was voorbij en daar zag ik vader en moeder ook
al aahkomen wandelen ik er op een holletje naar toe op hun
gezichten was vreugde te lezen en dat was voor mij genoeg
om te weten waar ik aan toe was
midden in de onvermijdelijke knuffelpartijen nota bene
zomaar op straat rukte ik me los want ik had het verraderlijke
withe kaftje uit moeders tasje zien stekenik trok het er uit en mompelde even kijken terwijl mijn
ogen reeds over dp cijfers vlogen daarna lachte ik mijn van zor
gen bevrijde lach ik wierp me in moeders arinenen wist van ge
luk niets anders te doen dan alsmaar laohen en juichen daarna
gaf ik mijn ouders een arm en zo lie pen we huiswaarts en ik
lachte weer want vader fluisterde me veelbelovend in het oor
dat hij een verrassing voor me had

t ihhh f t i fh hihhh hterwijl wo om het ka npvuur zaten on liedjes zongen wac tri
ton we onge child ig op het sein reeds een kwartier geleden had de
hopnan ons een leven gegeven het leven is een stukje touw
dat je achter aan je riem draagt en als het tijdens het spel van
je afgenomen wordt ben je dood
de vlag van onze groep was al in de aarde geplant we moesten
hun vlag proberen te veroveren en de verkenners van de andere
groep die ook in de buurt kampeerdem moesten de onze bemachtigen
plotseling hoorden we drie lange fluit stoten eindelijk het sein
tiedereen op zijn plants riep de kampvuurleider nauwelijks
waren we vertrokken of ik zag een donkere gedaante voortrennen
frank probeerdo hem tegen te houden de aanvaller was hem echter
te viug af hij rende in mijp righting sneldook ik achter een
struik en toen hij langs mij been rende nan ik een sprong en
daar lagen we al boven op mekaar
ik lag wel boven maar de slimmerik bleef op zijn rug liggen
eri ik kon hem niet tmodent want hoe ik ook probeerde om hem om
te draaien hij bleef als aan de grond vastgeplakt gelukkig kwam
frank aangekropen
ftneem jij deze voor je rekening fluisterde ik
tgoedtt antwcordde hij en op een niet al te zachtzinnige manier
greep hij de gevangene vast en draaide hem om en rukte het stuk
je bliksemsnel weg
geruisloos sloop ik ondertussen verder
daar zag ik drie donkere figuren aankomen dat is toch wel wat
te vteel voor mijtt dacht ik en drukte me plat tegen de grond
ze zagen me niet en verder kroop ik voort
toen ineens nog geen twintig meter verder zag ik de
vijandelijke vlag wapperen nog voorzichtiger vervolgde ik mijnsept eerste schooldag iedereen begint weer vol goede moed

veel medewerking van de leerlingenj t t
na school houden ook onze leraars hun eerste vergadering

ting werkelijk als een
hagedis sloop ik geruisloos
verder
ongelukklgerwijze werd
ik plotseling opgemerkt
zo snol ik kon dook ik in
een kuil die ik ergens aan
mijn rechterkant had opge
merkt doodstil bleef ik
hierin liggen
ik hoorde de stemmen
van twee jongens
hij moet hier in de buurt
zijn
en ze kwamen steeds dichtcr
bij
toen klonk het hard de vlag wordt aangevallen kom vlug
we moeten onze vlag redden laten we gauw gaan helpen
antwoordde de andere verkenner sfeamen verdwenen ze
verder sloop ik en ik zag hoe het gevecht plaats vond
helaas werden onze aanvallers teruggeslagen en moesten vluchten
dat is mijn kans dacht ik ik passeerde de vijandelijke wacht
posten en al gauw lag ik vlak bij de lag niemand had er iets
van gemerkt
stevig hieid ik de verkennersstok waar de vlag aan vast
zat beet en trok uit alle macht toen rende ik zc hard ik kon
naar veilig gebied de twee wachters waren zo verschrokken dat
ze alleen maar verbaasd hadden staan toekijken
de vlag de vlag ze hebben de vlag gestolen hoorde ik nog
achter mij roepen maar ik was al dicht bij ons eigen kampement
nog een klein stukje en we hadden gewonnen of beter gezegd
ikhad gewonnen ik had echt van het sluipspemgenotenj

veel nieuws voor sommige zal het be si st erg welkom zijn
vooral toor onze tbasketballers
toen onze school vorig jaar een uitnodiging kreeg van
de basketballbond cm mee te doen met de competitie hebben
we hieraan geen gehoor gegeven door allerlei omstandigheden
dit jaar echter hoorden we al heel gauw geruchten van
een schoolbasketballteam enkele tiendeklassers kwamen
op het idee en de trainingen zijn zelfs al in voile gang
de bedoe ling is nu om met een team mee te gaan spelen in
de bklas en we moeten in puike conditie zijn als eenmaal
de competitie begint

geachte abonnees
zoals u zult lezen bij het journaal van lsc zat de redak
tie even in de put toen er op oktober geen copie was
enige dagen later was er volop zodat we zelfs het een en ander
hebben moeten laten liggen voor de volgende maand oa een inter
essant verslag van het internaatsleven op curaao van onze ex
redaktrice amanda arends
de reaktie van enkele trouwe lezeressen van het mc wordt
op bl afdoende beantwoord vermoed ik de reaktie leidt ons
blad stelt het samen en zorgt voor illustraties maar de artike
len moeten hoofdzakelijk kamen van onze abonnees van de leerlin
gen dus en we doen hierbij vooral een beroep op het la he col
lege die in deze beslist te schuchterzijn
stuur verder uw pennevruchten in vr de de van de maand
anders wordt het te veel hurry hurry en daar leidt ons blad on
der de meeste redakteurs zitten in de de klas die zouden dan
op het einde van de maand een nadelig saldo krijgen wat hun pun
ten betreft
cd
neen jeugdige lezertanderis geen nieuw ontdekt lichaams
deel teen en tanderis dialectisch nederlands voort een en t
ander dit artikeltje zal dus niet een doorlopend geheel vormen
met bijv de bekende driedeling inleiding eigenlijke onderwem
en het slot maar van alles en nog wat een slimme lezer zegt
dij zich zelf een teken dat de schrijver geen onderwerp kan
l f t een bijd heelt of geen tijd meent te hebben of iets
dergelijks antwoord niet onmogelijk maar vergeet niet dat de
ici cr ook niet op commando kan dichten dat de componist even
min op commando kan dichten een nieuwe symphonie kan spelenof
zomaarten lied uit zijn mouw kan schudden en toch wensen de
redacteuren dat wiet dat ik hun dat erg kwalijk neem een redak
teur van een tijdschriftje heeft altijd twee pijlen op zijn
boog hij schrijft zlf of hij vraagt een ander en in dat
laatste geval is er niet altijd de gewenste insniratie of zin
in het eerste nummer van de derde jaargang stonden een naar
vragen en geen retorische vragen waarom dus niet een antwoord
geprobeerd
vraag waarom kiest iemand mulo met wiskunde als er op
aruba zoveel gebrek aan boekhouden is
iemand kiest wiskunde en niet handel niet omdat hij handel
een waardeloos vak vindt of omdat hij wiskunde zo leuk vindt
maar omdat het nu eenmaal nodig is wiskunde gehad te hebben om
op een andere school verder te kunnen mogen studeren
en heel veel jongens en meisjes willen die mogelijkheid niet uit
s luiten en dat ze verder willenstuderen komt nog al eens voor
omdat ze toch nog geen werk kunnen vinden
nu zou iemand kunnen vragen waarom niet bijv frans laten
vallen in klas en en dan handel en wiskunde handhaven
inderdaad een goed idee dat echter al eerder is besproken en
helaas practisch is afgewezen weer in verband met die mogelijk
heid voor ter dere studie waarbij frans vereist blijft dus
voor kweekschool en hbs dit is te meer wraar omdat bijna niemand
na de ste klas al definitief een studiekeuze meent te kunnendoenvraag
is boekhouden alleen voor de dommen
wat een vraag die is zeker niet gesteld door iemand die
zelf van dit vak op de hoogte is ze is dan ook zeker niet van de
heer engelbarts zelf maar is hem blijkbaar door anderen gesteld
dat iemand tot zon domme vraag is kunnen komen komt mogelij om
dat hij zij op de school gemerkt heeft dat iemand die moeilijk
leerde de handelsklas koos in plaats van de wiskundeklas en het
eenvoudige muloexamen tenminste het zogenaamde ap dat is alge
meen programma is zo gering dat om dat weinige handelsrekenen
te kennen men desnoods wel enigszins dom mag zijn
maar l om meer dan dat kleine beetje van dat vak te kennen zijn
hersens en vooral uithoudingsvermogen want zonder dat
zijn hersenen een dood kapitaal nodig tussen haakjes juist om
dat het a p zo weinig geeft wordt het door iets zwaarders en veel
beters vervangen maar omdat dit muloexamenhandel zo eenvoudig
is concluderen dat dus boekhouden voor de dcmmen is is er in eik
geval helemaal naash
ik heb wel eens pientere leerlingen gekend die toch de
handelsklas kozen en dan met prachtige cijfers slaagden ook
toor de andere vakken omdat het bij hen vaststond dat ze niet
verder gingen shuderen
de fout zit echter hierin dat men na het muloexamen voor dit vak
boekhouden niet verder gaat hierover zo dadelijkjneer
efet feit dat er op aruba geen
personen zijn die het braktijkdi
ploma boekhouden hier hebben gehaald
is wel een bewijs dat boekhouden niet
voor de dcmmen is
goekbquffeo
vcxv j
vraag
waarom is er zo weinig aniis
m voor deze studie be
doeld dus voor degenen die de mulo
verlaten hebben
het antwoord kan zyn l de velen
die verder gaan studeren uts hbs
kweekschoolvallen meteen al uit e
daal zouden juist goede klanten bij zijn
er is wel animo ik heb een jaar gekend dat men met cursis
tenbegon voor praktijkdiploma boekhouden dus en na enkele
maanden bleven er geen over waarom omdat men niet de moed
had tw drie jaar deze studie vol te houden
het is daarom een praktisch en realistisch idee van de heer
vd koppel geweest te starten met een cursus boekhouden i en
daarna boekhouden ii die elk slechts een half jaar duurden en
uitsluitend op de praktiek hier waren gericht
dat is de manier een cursus van kortere duur zoals dat ook de
avondcursussen op de ats doen
beeft men deze twee cursussen met succes doorlopen dan heeft men
al iets breikt en bij menigeen is er dan wel de moed en de vol
hardende zin om ook het praktijkdiploma aan te rakken om van
mb a nog maar niet te spreken
helaas zijn deze cursussen opgehouden het is te hopen dat
ze binnen afzienbare tijd weer terug zullen keren ze waren ab
soluut niet alleen maar bestemd voor leerlingen die het handels
diplomabehaald hadden
iemand die na de ste klas de handel vaarwel heeft gezegd omdat
hij nu eenmaal de wiskundeklas koos moet het dwaze vooroordeel
tdat boekhouden voor de dommen zou zijn opzij zetten en kan na
zijn mulodiplorna met wiskunde zeker voor boekhouden gaan stude
ren juist omdat de behoefte aan bekwame boekhouders groot is
vraag kan ik veronderstellen dat iemand met een muldiplma
zelfstandig verder kan studeren of is dit te veel
gevraagd
de waarheid de ervaring heeft
dat uitgewezen is dat de meeste
leerlingen die tegenwoordig het
mulodiploma behalen niet zelf
standig kunnen verder studeren
ze hebben een cursus nodig
dit komt gedeeltelijk doordat het
mulosysteem uitleggen nogeens
uitleggen precies alles opgevencontroleren aansporen en aanporren het selfst studeren
niet ere bevordert maar zu dlt allemaal niet ge beu e
dan zou door heel velen het mulodiploma niet behaald worden
dit is niet algemeen waar er zijn leerlingen die garende
behandeingleren zelfstandig te werken maar wel voor een groot
percentage
fven een opmerking om misverstand te voorkomen zelfstandig
stude reiis tegengestelde van onder leiding studeren en niet
tet tegenstelde van domweg van buiten leren ditste
mensonwaardig en zal op een gezonde mulo ook niet tot systeem
behoren dat een of andere leerling het toch doet is zijn f
hr saak en een doodenkele keer aal iedereen het eens mee
maken dat hij zegt ik snap het wel niet ik zal het dan m
bewonderen en vanbuiten leren
kt een andere opmerking een mulogeslaagde meent te gauw
ith tg cmdat hij in zekere zin namelijk van dit sc
ce de top de sddrbereikt heeft kt is echter nog maar
een stao hij zij moet begrijpen dat er verder gewerk m e
worden vroeger was dat mogelijk maar niet meer m onze tij
heeft menspaans of engels gehd er valt nog genoeg baj te ie
ren en er zijn nog zovele andere terreinen
dit was dan het een ifet s ecllde nifw
dat ik het hierbij laat met iedereen zal het thetbven
staande helemaal eens kunnen zijn en vooral zullen mogelijk n g
belangrijke factoren of beschouwingen vergeten zijn

gezondheidsdienst oranjestad ik klop op de eerste de beste
deur en vraag aan de verpleegster die open doet of ik jaar even
een paar vragen mag stellen
ja hoor ik heb alle tijd voor je ga maar zitten
zuster ik zie dat u een speldje op hebt wat betekent dat
wel dat betekent dat ik gediplomeerd verpleegster ben en dus
wetteijkbeschermd
en dat ooievaartje wat betekent dat eigenlijk
nou dat betekent dat ik kraam heb
mag u dus ook bevallingen f dooft
nee daar moet men vroedvrouw of dokter voor wezen ik mag al
leen de dokter assisteren bij een bevalling en moeder en kind
verzorgen
kunt u nog meer aantekeneingen halen behalve kraam
jazeker oa de kinderaantekening de wijk en het zwarte kruis
het zwarte kruis
ja een zwartekruisverpleegster is gespecialiseerd in het
verzorgen van geestelijk gestoorde patinten
waar hebt u uw opleiding gehad zuster hier op aruba
nee dat kon destijds niet mijn opleiding heb ik in nederland
gehad in twee verschillende ziekenhuizen in zevenaar en den haag
hoe lang duurt de opleiding
de opleiding voor het adiploma
duurt drie jaar en dat heb ik
dus in zevenaar behaald en dan
nog zes maanden kraamopleiding
in den haag
jntsjyvw
jvwrwelke opleiding wordt er vereist
minstens mulodiploma maar men maakt ook wel eens uitzonderin
gen op deze regel
houdt u van uw beroep
ja ik beschouw het meer als een roeping
hoe bent u er toe gekomen om verpleegster te worden
met mij is het heel gek gegaan xk wilde n eerst medisch ana
liste worden ik heb dan ook een tijdje in een laboratorium ge
werkt maar dat viel mij erg tegen ik miste het contact met an
deren daar ik veel vriendinnen had in de verpleging heb ik het
toen in de verpleging geprobeerd en tot nu toe heb ik er ecnt
geen spijt van gehad ik kan mij geen mooier beroep voorstellen
dan het verpleegsterwerk
waarin bestaat eigenlijk uw werk zuster
zoals je ziet werk ik op de gezondheidsdienst als assistente
van de psychiater ik doe ook huisbezoeken en breng de heel erg
gestoorden naar curaao daar er hier geen inrichting rcor is
vindt u dat niet erg
wel nee want ze slapen onderweg en bovendien heb ik altijd een
politieagent bij me
u hebt wel een erg afwisselend werk zuster zoiets zou ij
beslist ook wel aantrekken wie weet misschien worden we later
nog wel eens collegas
wel zuster ik wil u verder niet van het werk afhouden
heel hartelijk dank voor dit interessant gesprek en veel succes
met uw mooi werk
geen dank juffrouw en tot ziens

d a n k ook do z maand weer hebben de neisjes van het maria
college voor ta lrijke inzendingen gezorgdwaarom kiep ieslnd iulo met wiskunde als er op arj veel
gebrek is aan boekhouders
a omdat wiskunde voor sommigen misschien gemakkelijker is
dan boe knorden
b omdat er ook velen zijn die denken dat wiskundige knapper
zijn of dit waar is mag joost weten
is boekhouden alleen voor de doemen
helemaal niet als dat het geral was dan zou er op aruba geen
gebrek zijn aan boekhouders
waarom is er zo weinig animo voor deze studie
misschien wel omdat het juist zo moeilijk is
km ik veronderstellen dat iemand met een mulodiploma zelf
standig verder kan studeren oe is dat te veel gevraagd
bij enkele vooral nog t jonge leerlingen kan dit wel te
veel gevraagd zijn
nog enkele oevierkingen
u met niet veronderstellen dat er op het maria college de
meisjes alles wordt voorgekauwd om het alleen maar door
te slikken daar vergist u zich ini

gaarsnederlandse meester musicus geza frid verzorgden de eerste
culturele voorstelling voor de de klassers

genoten hadden en daarvoor werden we beloond met de derde sonate
van beethoven

het was een grote vreugde voor het volk van aruba dat hm
de koningin en zkh prins bernard het met een bezoek vereerden
men was enige weken tevoren al begonnen met het illumineren ran de
gouvernementsgebouwen en de nederlandse en antilliaanse vlaggen
werden uitgestoken er werd ook een beroep gedaan op de winkeliers
om hun etalages te versieren
s avonds zag je een heleboel mensen door de straten en langs
de boulevard rijden en wandelen om naar de verlichting te en
het was allemaal schitterendvooral het bestuurscollege en de util
lem iii toren waren fantastisch
ou oktober was ik al vroeg wakker en wekte mijn kleine broer
omdat hij zich snel moest aankleden om met de welpen naar het vlieg
veld te gaan daar zouden ze voor de koningin en de prinsals ere
wacht fungeren belaas koude de andere familieleden er met hem
gaan want mijn vader had de wachten moest thuisblijven ik ging
met miin andere broers naar de stad om toch maar een g van
het koninklijk paar op te vangen wij waren net bij la esperanza
gekomen ten ze voorbij kwamen ik vond dat de koningin zowel
als de prins er jonger uitzagen dan op de fotos zij groetten de
mensen die langs de kant van de weg stonden waarop wij terug
wuifden on juichten
wij gingen toen de zeven provincin bekijken er waren vee
mensen
mensen va r men mocht het schip pas s middags om uur bezichtigei
daarna gingen we op stap naar het postkantoor daar stonden de
scholen netjes ongesteld terwijl ze net als wip op de kom
van het koninkliik paar wachtten eindelijk kwamen ze aan de kin
deren met de vlaggetjes inde handen juichten de koningin en e
prins uitbundig toe terwijl wi met de handen zwaaiden net
komnklijk paar verscheen even later met het gevolg en andere aan
wezigen op t balkon frre aloxius dirigeerde en de schoolkinde
ren zongen uit volle borst op de dag dat zevertrokken hadden
wij lekker vrij heerlijk
leve de koningin leve de prinsh hintz a mc

de laatste twee weken wan het baseball seizoen waren de meest
glorieuze momenten voor de dodgers hoewel ze bijna heel het sei
zoen door aan de kop waren bleek het of ze hun ster tommy da vis
niet misten het werk van sandy koufax don drysdale en maury
wills was formidabel koufax won wedstrijden en drysdale ein
digde met wedstrijden wat betekent dat ze samen meer dan de
helft van ie gewonnen wedstrijden wonnen maury wills was
altijd de leider in het offensief met batting average en
stal ook nog honken het hoogste aantal
in de american league was het ai voorspeld voor de all star
game wie de uitblinkers waren de minnesota twins hadden zoals
de dodgers bijna heel het seizoen door de leiding dit was de
eerste pennant voor de twins terwijl de dodgers reeds meermalen
ennants behaalden
om een triomfantslijk seizoen van de dodgers te completeren
wonnen ze ook nog de ivorld series in zeven wedstrijden steunend
op koufax behaalden ze de overwinning de ster verloor zijn
beginwedstrijd maar won daarna
twee wedstijdon een nfourhittern
in de vijfde wedstrijd en een
threehitterm in de laatste wed
strijd allen dachten dat de dod
gers met hun pitchers en de twins
mehun batters zouden werken
maar de dodgers kwamen tervoor
schijn met hun pitching hitting
en runningbe eerste en tweede wedstrijd
kwinexx in handen van de twins vol
gens mijn bescheiden mening verlo
ren de dodgers deze beide wedstrijd
den door de kou
maar de dodgers kwamen weer in
vorm in las angelus hun thuisbasis
waar zij dan ook dedrie volgende
wedstijden overtuigend wonnen
vooral de hit and run van de dodgers was groots in deze
wedstrijden in totaal werden er verder honken gestolen
in de vijfde wedstrijd was koufax
zozeer in vorm dat hij op weg was een
no hitter tewerpen maar dit eindig
de in de vijfde inning toen killebrew
de geweldige batter van de twins een
basehit sloeg
toen de stand was in het voor
deel van de dodgers kwamen de twins wee
in de race en wonnen de zesde wed
strijd j irci grant was de eerste die twee
wedstrijden won in de series toen hij
in deze wedstrijd een zege behaald
de in de laatste wedstrijd de zevende stelden de dodgers air
hun hoop op hun ster pitcher sandy koufax de uitslag liet wel
bli ken dat hij de beste werper van onze tijd is met een
zege en met slechts drie hits tegen werd hij uitgeroepen tot de
hero van de world series en kreeg
daarbij een corvette
koufax verscheen in drie wedstrij
den en won er twee vanf hij bezorgde
mannen een strike out gaf
vrije honken en stond slechts runs
toe beide unearned de beste batters
waren maury wil is met hits en ftn
fairly ook waarvan homeruns

op je bromfiets zit een klein plaatje meestal op het motor
blok daar staat je motorncmmer op en het vermogen vn de motor
meestal lees je  cc en h p deze twee getallen ver
tellen je hoe sterk je motor is en datis echt geen klein beetjei
een h p betekent een horsepower hu moet je niet direct
denken aan een paard want tussen een oude knol een trek
paard en een racepaard is veel verschil in kracht
een paardekracht is kilo en meter omhoog trekken in n se
conde als je sterk bent kun jij dat ook wel maar je houdt dat
niet lang vol
jouw bromfiets kan dat uren achter elkaar een geweldige
prestatie voor zofn klein motortje maar hij doet het alleen als
je hem goed te eten geeft in je boekje staat olie
geef je te weinig olie dan zet de zuiger te veel uit het hart
van de motor wordt gloeiend heet en plotseling zit de zuiger dan
muurvast en je hebt dan nog geluk gehad heel vaak breekt
er dan iets van binnen af
maar t veel olie is ook verkeerd ja het is wel leuk am
rookgrdijnen te leggen op de straat maar de meeste olie ver
brandt in de cylinder en de ttastt ervaren rijders noemen dat
ttkooltt gaat de uitgangen van het hart verstoppengeef je nu vol gas dan helpt dat weinig ffet gas kan maar lang
zaam in de cylinder komen door die verstopte gaten je hebt nu
geen p k onder je zadel maar slechts een h p
sommige jongens menen dat ze de geluidsbarrire moeten door
breken ze gaan prutsen aan de uitlaatpijp binnen in die prach
tig glanzende pijp zit nog een pijp met heel teel gaatjes haal
die er maar uit dan heb je geen claxon meer nodig
maar je h p vliegen vlug wegj je laat je paarden
los zonder dat ze eerst voor je werken ffet gas inde cylinder
aarzelt geen ogenblikj
binnen in de cylinder is het zo heetj er uitj zo gauw
mogelijk er uitfc voor dat de sparkplug komt met zijn vonk
de weg is immers vrij nu de uitlaatbuis zo lekker ruim is ge
worden
je ziet dus wel dat de uitlaat nog wel iets meer doet dan
alleen het gelid smoren
wil je veel plezier van je bromfiets hebben dan moet hij
op tijd in de ftservicem dat kun je ook zelf doen

tot mijn grote schande een geluk nog dat je bij het eten wel
je mond open mag doen behalve dan voor het happen in de studie

jdaar tonze tienerstt vroege om meer teenagersartikelen
hebben we hier een verrassings een song quizz lill zo er veel
belangstelling is gaan we ermee door
oplossing inleveren voor december prijg s tn tepjn plaat
richard briezenja dats als oen atoombcm
zoals jullie yel yrcten zijn do bcaiies bi j volon lioel erg gezien
niet alleen bij de jeugd de teenagersy maar ook bij de anderen
als er iots slochts gessegd uordt over de beatles nou dan
vcrzeker ik jullio dat ik ze wel zal verdedigen
waarom nou heel geinakkelijk
de beatles hebben namenlijk iets heel groots gepresteerd wat veel
filmsterren in al hun jaren niet gemakkelijk gedaan zouden hebben
de beatles hebben in zeer korte tijd de jeugd aangewakkerd nau
welijks horen zij een plaat van de beatles of ze schreeuwen mee
en maken de gekste figuren wat ze dansen noemen
sinds de beatlesplaten op de markt zijn hebben heel wat
jongens hun kaar een ietsje langer en dragen veel meer jeans dan
vroeger
ij meisjes hebben nu geen permanent meer maar laten ons
haar sluik hangen
als we nu de beroemde beethoven bekijken zien we dat hij
heus niet zofn grote groep mensen geenthousiasmeerd heeftred
maar ofschoon de beatles veel voor hun succes overhebben hebben
ze natuurlijk wl tijd om naar meisjes uit te kijken
zodoende zijn er al drie getrouwd ende laatste paul blijft
ook niet achter en zal binnenkort trouwen
wel is het heel rg jammer dat volgens het laatste tttiener
nieuwstt paul als hij trouwt niet meer bij het kwartet zal blijven
ja er valt niets te treuren en laten we allen hopen dat er
in zijn plaats ook een heel goede en flinke beatle zal komen

oooooooooooooooooobooooooo
december pries terzaterdag j
onze antilliaanse priesterstudenten rekenen op ons gebed
en od onze maandelijkse bijdrage denken jullie daraan
oooooooooooooooovfeten jullie wie zolli is nu dan zal ik het jullie tertellen
zolli is een heel verlegen jongen hij is nogal arrn hij
loopt met een gelapte broek en kapotte schoenen altijd ziet hij
er vuil uit zijn haren zijn steeds wir war door elkaar eigen
lijk heet hij niet zo maar hij kreeg die naam omdat hij een
echte zolli was
nu ga ik eigenlijk de geschiedenis vertellen nou zolli
had eens een meisje en wou haar een serenade geven flet was op
een zondag toen het nsucn sucutt begon te worden vertrokken
zolli en zijn vrienden ja zei hij ze slapen al zolli en zijn
vrienden begonnen te zingen en gitaar te spelen nauwelijks
stondn ze een minuut te zingen of de deur ging oen zolli zei
nu korit ze ze komt luisteren vvet je het zeker vroegen zijn
vrienden ja ze i zolli ze komt naar ons luisteren
maar arme zolli flet was de vader van zijn vriendinnetje die
met een ttcarbachit in de hand aankwam net toen zolli weer
een ander lied wilde inzetten stond de woedende vader voor hem
en zelfs niet allen de verontvaardigde vader maar ook nog en
kele potige broers  de carbachi begon te tregenentt
zolli en zijn vrienden kozen zo snel ze konden het hazenpad
van die dag af heeft zolli nooit meer aan ttserenadestt gedachto
zijn vrienden hadden hem ook nog eventjes onderhanden geno
men alsof die carbachi nog niet genoeg was geweestj
van toen af noemde hem iedereen tfzollitt
ttkaentje bij de kappertt
m oduber c mc
de kapper ften hoe wil je dat ik je haren knipt
koentje ttasjeblief hetzelfde als vader met een open plek in
het midden ttin dit derda nuimner van onze nbao di kwihin zal ik ook eens
iets naar voren brengen het heeft iets te maken met de vragen
die beantword werden door fr arnoldr ht gaat dus over boek
houdene toen ik in de achtste klas zat kregen we handel n
viskunde aan het eind van dat schooljaar moesten we kiezen
er waren drie achtste klassen met ngeveer leerlingenf hiervan
kozen er de iskundeklas als zij tenminste over zouden gn
z kwameri er dus slechts jongens in de handlsklasj
dit komt volgens mij doordat fr arnold het hele jaar door
bleef zeggen ndenk erom jongens als je de handelsklas kiest
dan kun je daarna niet verder studerentt wel ditwas waar
dit is waar dit zal waar blijven maar toch vind ik dit niet fn
reden om de jongens van de ste klassensfceeds maar te blijven zeg
gen ttals je de handelsklas kiest kun je niet verder studerent
hierdoor komt het dat zo weinig jongens de handelsklas kiezen
ik noem dit een soort ttpropagandatt voor de xviskundeklas
ikzelf heb de handelsklas gekozen enkele keren heeft frre
arnold me gevraagd of ik er geen spijt van had nu ik kan eer
lijk zeggen tik heb er beslist geen spijt vantt dit jaar zijn
er slechts jongens die handel doen c en het gaat zeer
goed  e ffet voorgaande is niet bedoeld als kritiek op frre r
nold ffet is alleen maar mijn mening dat dit de reden is dat er
zo weinig jongens hsndel en boekhouden kiezen
maar nu volgt wel een kr it iek  a in het vorige nummer stond
op bladz bij ttfeaktiett het volgende
vr is boekhouden alleen voor de dommen antw ffelemaal niet
als dat het geval was zou er geen gebrek zijn aan boekhoudersj
ik kan onmogelijk geloven dat een arubanse jongen meisje
dit geschreven kan hebben want hieruit volgt immers dt er op
aruba heel veel dcmme mensen zijn dit is een bledigihgj
enkele jongens die hier op aruba werkloos rondlopen hebben
wel een diploma maar kunnen geen werk krijgen veel anderen zijn
niet d o m maar wel u i om te leren goed er zijn natuur
lijk ook zeker domme mensen op aruba maar dan hoeft zofn vraag
toch nog niet zo opgelost te worden als ik ongelijk heb kun
je gerust fn antwoord sturen  ttlvlultatulln c l sc
ervaringj  o iets schrijven over mijn
ervaringi mijn ervaring in de kleuterklas
q jeetje hoe moet ik nou beginnen ik zit pas
tviree maanden in de kleuterkls en veel erva
ring heb ik dus nog niet
maar ja ik wil er toch wel het een en ander van vertellen
hoeik op het idee kwam om bij de kleuters te gaan werken wel
dat kwam zo ik hoordetoevallig iemnd er over nraten vond het
werk ineens interessant nam een besluit en hier sta ik nu voor
een heleboel sqhattige gezichtjes
jullie zullen misschien verwonderd zijn hoe ik het aan kan
met zofn veertigtal pratende kinderen voor me maar geloof me
het zijn heus geen babbelkousen die als de onderwijzer met de
les bezig is nog even met deburen een tftheeuurtjett houden het
zijn niet van die lui die bij de tweede bel de bal nog een flinke
duw of trap moeten geven nee bij de kleuters heeft men geen bel
nodig men hoeft niet eens een keer te bellen laat staan twee
je kijkt ze slechts aan en ze zijn stil
bij de kleuters komt het noo it voor dat onder het tekenen
er eentje zegt tik kan het niet je vertelt ze bijv een
verhaaltje van een oud vrouvrbje en een poes als je hen dan even
later een tekenblaadje geeft zullen ze na tien minuten allemaal
iets er op hebben staan maar probeer dit nu eens bij de groten
de helft zal er niets maar dan ook niets op hebben staan dit is
niet bedoeld als kritiek maar dit is om jullie er op te wijzen
waarom ik deze richting gekozen heb
je moeh bij de kleintjes wel goed opletten als je hen iets
vertelt want owee als je iets verkeerd zegt of als ze je niet
goed begrepen hebben  het gebeurde laatst nog dat een juf
frouv de kleuters vertelde over adam en eva want godsdientleskrijgen ze ook dat die dam en eva een
appel hadden gegeten en toen niet
meer in het paradijs mochten blijven
een ventje dat niet zo erg goed had
opgelet en het dus niet goed begrepen had
ging naar huis en weigerde zijn appel
tje te eten
na veel gevraag biechtte het jongentje
het bij zijn ouders ops tik eet nooit geen
appels meer anders mag ik het paradijs
niet in tt
zo zien jullie dus dat het bij de kleintjes ook niet
altijd een gemakkelijk levent je is je moet je werk met aandacht
en vooral met liefde doen anders slaag je er niet in
trouwens is het niet zo dat er zonder liefde nergens
in de wereld iets goeds gedaan of bereikt kan worden

hopi hendelaatst stolde iemand voor eens een kritiek in te sturen
om de jongens van het l s c aan te wakkeren ook eens wat te
schrijven voor hun en ons blad want het is een feit dat ze met
maar weinig artikels voor de dag komen in bau di kwihi ik weet
niet hoe het kwam maar opeens kreeg ik er ztn in
iiier zit ik dan met een leeg papier voor me ttkritiek tegen
de jongens omdat ze niet eens even de tijd kunnen nemen om
hun stem ook eens te laten horen in bodk zeg eens jongens ons
blad is er toch niet alleen voor de meisjes maar ook voor jul
lie dfw z julli kunneh en zijn zelfs verplicht ook regelmatig

sproken wij zijn toch ook altijd bereid iets te schrijven en
we zullen dat blijven volhouden
kom nou ttlaga flchep un banda stop du trasteriat ik ge
loof niet dat jullie echt niets wetei te schrijven met een beet
je goede wil komen er vap jullie oojr prachtige artikels die wij
heel graag zullen lezene zitteher op te wachtenj

is een wegtt dus begin maar hjwlnen van die wegot en
dan profiteren we er allemaal vanlaat je hersens maar eens werken klim in je pen dan is er
volgehde maand zelfs geen plaats meer voor onze artikels

dan toch wel op een fabriek yroeger ging hij te voet naar zijn
werk  hij kan nou eenmaal geen auto besturen vergist zich tus
sen rem en gaspedaal en van de versnelling is hij bang de vijf
de en laatste die hem rijles gaf had nog als advies ttraak astu
blief geen autots meer aanjtr maar door de zon lonen vindt hij na
tuurlijk ook vreselijk en dasjrom rijdt hij nu met een vriendelij
ke kennis mee in een superdeluxe wagen
niet lang geleden zei zijn zoon tegen me dat hij ook al aan
het sparen was voor een t v ja hij was al bijna uitgespaard
onze buurman spaart n altijd voor iets nieuws want hij wil
perse geen schuldeno
op een middag zat hij rustig bij de radio te luisteren wel
deze radio zit blijkbaar vastgeroest on vidtoria want geen an
der station dringt hier binnen met zijn allen zingen ze dan soms
mee vooral b ij de heel treurige liedjes dan lijkt het wel een
dodewake ook voor zijn pickup heeft ie zijn soeciale plaatjes
eentje van die platen is gewoon grijs van ouderdom ja ik zou
gaan vertellen over zijn radio
als hij de radio weereens wil
aanzetten komt er niks zijn fa
voriete muziek klinkt niet op uit het
kastje de volumeknop gaat helemaal
naar rechts maar nog niks
als hij hem laat repareren dan
komen er schulden nee dat in geen
geval en zo moet hij wachten tot
dat ie tfgecobreerdtf heeft ja hoor
die zaterdagmiddag komt er iernand
die het euvel zal verhelpenals de reparateur binnenkomt hoort hij mompelens mik hoop dat je
hem weer gauv in orde hebt want ik kan mijn favoriete program
mafs niet missen en in zichzelf denkt de buurmans als het maar
te veel gaat kosten anders moet ilc schulden gaan maken
de reparateur echter heeft moeite om zijn lachen in te hou
den want hij merkt het rneteen de plug zit niet in het stopcon
tact maar ja hij moet toch iets verdienen nietwaar
hij steekt de plug er dus niet in en doet alsof het de moeilijk
ste reparatie van ajn leven is hij draait aan alles waaraan maar
te draaien is snuffelt in de radio schroeft hem open en haalt
zijn ingewandenft er een voor een uit terwijl hij alsmaar mom
pelt ttplenty work plenty worktt
hven later gaat hij zelfs zijn baas opbellen om hem mee te
delen dat hij nog een paar uur tfovertimem moet werken
ttdat zal weleen gepeperde rekening wordent denkt de arme
buurman als hij eindelijk ziet dat de spullen er weer een voor
een in gaan wat hij echter niet gezien heeft is dat de repara
teur in een onbewaakt ogenblik gauw de plug in het stopcontact
gestoken heeft
eindelijk hetis ondertussen al dohker geworden is al les
klaar en kan het toestel geprobeerd worden
toevallig staat het op een ander station en ineens schet
tert het door het huis tti cantt get no satisfact iont
de buren schuiven de gordijnen open verbaasd over die mu
ziek die nu uit de radio komt wat zou er nu toch met hen ge
beurd zijn maar daar is reeds onze brave buurman naar het toe
stel gesneld en zoekt zljn station nik houd niet van d eze plaat
zegt hij verontschuldigend
tthet is anders de tttophittt wist je dat nog niettt vraagt
de ander verbaasd terwijl hij de rekening schrijft en daarna af
geeft met bevende handen wordt die in ontvangst genomen het
bedrag is vreselijk hoog veel hoger dan het beseheiden sommetje
dat hij momenteel in zijn portemonnaie heeft zitten

maandag oktober om half negenstapten we de lasallia
nen de en lode klassers naar het cultureel centrum om van on
ze tweede oor de negende klaasers de eerste culturele voor
stelling te genieten
iedereen genoot geweldig van het spel en van de muziek uit
een iialiaanse opera vier bedrijven lang zaten we vol gespannen
aandacht te kijken en te luisteren
na afloop trokken er enige redaktieleden op uit voor een in
terview met deze artisten
meneer brugman kunt u ons zeggen wanneer dit marionetten
theater werd opgericht
wel dat gebeurde in door mijn vader met enige mede
werkers
maar moest u een aparte studie volgen of had u er aanleg
voor want zo erg gemakkelijk lijkt me dit heus niet
nee ik heb geen aparte studie
moeten volgen wij zijn er van
kleins af in opgegroeid we hielpen
vader zo vaak zodat we de kuhst
ook leerden
wel kregen we natuurlijk een
muzikale opleiding speciaal in de
richting ttoprette en operamuziekt
hoe wordt deze kunst nu eigen
lijk genoemdwel ik zou zo zeggen tmarionettenkunst maar ik denk dat
dit woord zo langzamerhand in het ifederlands in onbruik is ge
raakt
hebt u mensen die u helpen
jazeker we zijn met zijn vieren hier oo ruba rnaar er zijn
ook enkele medewerkers in mederland gebleven
hebt u dit bewegingssysteem zelf uitgevonden
ja toen dit theater door rnijn vader ongericht was gebruik
ten we nog draadmarionetten maar in de oorlogsjaren was het ver
verrg moeilijk en we gingen met handroppen werken
kunt u ons nop iets vertellon over de decors
uie zijn in drie dimenties zoals je hier kunt zien ze zijn
van een lichte stof pemaakt maar in nederland yrerken we met veel
zwaardere decors
hoe vond u de sfeer hier in de zaal
eerlijk gezgu veel beter dan bij de voorstelling opsan
nicolaas het lijkt dat de leerlingen hier rneer gecultiveerd zijn
bent u nu op tournee en hoeveel voorstellingen geeft
u zo ongeveer per jaar
ja we waren een week op curagao hier geven we opvoeringen
en dan gaan we naar bonaire saba st eustatius venezuela en
trimiad tegen kerstmis zijnwe veer in federland
we vinden het eiland heerlijk vooral basirutfe waar we lo
geren en we hebben alles volop bekeken ja we geven ongeveer
voorstellingen per jaar waar ongeveer mensen naar ko
men kijken ook zijn we opgetreden in het ufeninhlijk paleis

tje zo te zien een belhamel uit de armzalige volkswij
ken alles wat liij aan heeft zijn een paar oude ver
sleten schoenen een vuile gescheurde broek een oude
trui en onder een oude pet komen zijn slordige piek
haren tevoorschjjn die in geen maanden geknipt zijn
met begerige ogen kijkt hij door de winkelruiten
naar binnen maar hij weet wel dat niets van al het
moois dat hij ziet zijn deel kan worden alle mensen
die hij op straat ontmoet zijn blij en vrolijk niemand
schenkt aandacht aan de sjofel geklede ongen die hon
gerig en verkleumd door de straten zwerft
nee hij heeft niets niets in deze vereld vader
noch moeder heeft hij gekend en de oude vrouyr die
hem opgevoed heeft is enige tijd geleden gestorven
en zo is hij nu aan zijn lot overgelaten het enige
waar hij meestal aan moet denken is hoe hij zijn
honger zal stillen
wordt nu al laat veel lichten zijn al uit
r gegaan ifet jongetje is op het grote kerkplein aan
gekomen waar hij rond blijft slenteren vroege kerk
gangers lopen vlug naar binnen hij zou ook wel de
kork binnengegaan zijn maar hij durft niet want hij
heeft alleen wat vodden om zijn lijf hij gaat in
een hoek bij de grote deur zitten in de sneeuw hij
luistert naar hetgelui van de klokken en naar de
zachte tonen van het orgel hn daarna slaapt hij in
rj brr wat is het koud weer bromt een agent
terwijl hij met de handen op zijn ru over het kerkplein
wandelt in deze nacht moet ik surveilleren hij komt f
bij de kerkdeur kijlfb naar binnen naar het altaar eei
biedig maakt hij een kruisteken dan loopt hij verder
at lipt dar voer rommel bij de kerk op kerstmis eeh

die tijdens haar leven zeer godsdienstig yas hij

ooooongeveer a jaar eeleden bestond er een tijd
schrift de lasso voor de leden van de verschillnde jeugd
verenigingen van de freres mevr laura iernetpaskel zou
enige verhalen schrijven over het aruba van vroeger de
ze verhalen heeft zij geschreven en het is heerlijk te le
zen over de oude tijd die wij ons niet meer kunnen voor
stellen jaimner genoeg bestond ondertussen het tijdschrift
de lasso niet meer en zijn die verhalen blijven liggen
enige jaren geleden stierf laura ttemet en deze vrien
delijke en achieve onderwijzeres werd vooral od santa cruz
zeer betreurd a kan zij ze ze if niet meer lezen en kun
nen wij er haar niet meer voor bedanken zullen we deze
verhalen uit de vergetelheid halen om ze te laten lezen
door de arubaanse jeugd waarvoor zij ze geschreven heeft
o o o
als kind zat ik soms te luisteren naar vaders gesnrek
ken met de buurman en dit zinnetje is me nog altijd bijge
bleven aruba ta mes grandi cu un pinita di maisji rabu
maar toch voelen wij ons groot en machtig en voornaam
en weten niet hoe ons e iland er uit zag jaar of zelfs
of jaar geleden a
als grootvader bij ons op bezoek kwam en wij kregen
hem zover dat hij iets begon te vertellen dan begon hij
altijd in die goede oude tijd toen l heer zich nog
indachtig was dat aruba bestond regende het erg veel
overal in het wild groeiden bonen pcmpoenen vatermeloe
nen en allerlei veldgewassen het eiland was dichtbegroeid
en koeien en geiten konden overal grazen naar hartelust
fen at zich een eeuw oud wanterwas voedsel genoeg zie
maar eens hoe oud wij worden wij kunnen niet eens dood
gaan en dan gaven ive mekaar een duvtje maar die roiiimel
die jullie tegenwoordig eten durven jullie dat nog de naam
voedsel te geven bahj
en als grootvader dit gezegd had vms hij zc veront
waardigd over de moderne tijd dah hij ophield meh vertellen
ach groohvader ik wou dah ooloheor je nu de pemiissie zou
geven om je ondergrondse woning voor een paar uur te verla
ten ifemel wat sou je staan kijken en mt zou je hard
naar je graf terughollen als je opeens het geronk van een
jet boven je hoofd hoordeoa
re gen tijd
dan render we naar de rooi die dichtbij ons huis stroom
de en wiens donderend geraas ojis als muziek in de oren klbnk
als de rooi heel hoog was ging vader mee vant dan was de
stroom te woest we plonsden en piaster en deden alsof het
dreigende spook van het planter niet boven ons hing
tlilnten dat betekende een of twee dagen in die
gloeiende zon op en neer met order je armen geklemd een
nap maisji semiao telkens vier of vijf korreltjes af
tellen en dan netjes in de hojo laten vallen dievader
so mooi met zijn chapi had gemaakt en dan elk kuiltje
met je voet netjes dichtmetselen niet te hard en niet te
zacht want vaders boze blik
roelden we achter ons
broer beweert zelfs dat hij
hij kon ineens op je af
j rennen terwijl de riem werd
losgemaakt

fijnste was toch wel coo p i n d a planten die moesten
yiq telkens drie tegelijk in de grond stoppen maar veel ven

ziezo carnaval is weer voorbij aan feesten etc is
voorlopig een eind gekomen en meteen zitten we weer in
een serieuze tijd niet alleen wat de vasten betreft
maar onze tiende klaasers zullen over weken volop in hun
schriftelijk examen zitten wij wensen sterkte en succes
op de volgende bladzijde bl breekt n van onze
trouwe lezers een lans voor de armen op ons eiland en levert
daarbij een goedbedoelde kritiek op het geschenk voor prin
ses beatrix en claus van amsberg graag wil de redaktie
vr je dat artikel leest por el amor de dios het volgende
opmerken bet koninklijk paar heeft ondertussen zelf bepaald
dat de opbrengst voor dit geschenk besteed zal worden voor
de gehandicapte kinderen van de antillen pa muchanan
mancaron zoals dat ook zal gebeuren in de andere rijksdelen
dit is wel een heel erg mooi gebaar van het koninklijk paar
en we hopen dat niettegenstaande die goedbedoelde kritiek
het bedrag tch nog zal groeien tot het welzijn van onze
kinderen die niet gezegend zijn met een gezond lichaamylmyji ct djos
iedereen lij waar je ook komt iedereen rraat over
het huwelijk van prinses beatrix en glaus van amsberg ie
dpreen heeft er belangstelling voor en ze zijn zelfs begon
nen met gfeld op tehalen voor een geschenk voor het konink
lijk paar
liaar toch is er en groephier op het eiland die er
zelfs geen tijd voor om hierover na te denken die
hebben belangrijker dingenom over te einzen vol vrees
denken ie aan wat de vlgende dag voor hen zal brengen
boor de mee sten van onsworden de ze vergeten
het zijn de armen ja hier op ons eiland zijn er heel
wat die hulp veel hulp nodig hebben op alle gebied komen
ze te kort ze hebben niet voldoende te eten niet voldoen
de kleren en vooral de kinderen zijn er de duoe van want
die kunnen zelfs niet naar school
amtcal doet zijn uiterste best om dit probleem hier
op aruba op te lossen maar och we weten dat de belangstel
ling hiervoor nog lang niet groot genoeg is ik bedoel daad
werkelijke belangstelling
goed het is prachtig als we eengeschenk willen geven
aan het koninklijk paar maar laten we dan eerst onze armen
helpen die hebben het ook veel harder nodig toen onze
koningin en prinsop aruba kwamen was het groot feest en de
regering heeft vl geld gebruikt om het eiland te versieren
prachtig maar wat hadden ze allemaal voor de armen kunnen
doen met ditzelfde geld het zou mr waarde gehad hebben
fpu koningin dit ook niet een reuzeidee gevonden hebben
vreb j of is dit alln maar een zaak voor onze priesters
en freres de beste versiering van het eiland zou vol
gens mij geweest zijn de armoede opruimenals men de armen helpt dan wordt je naam niet ergens
hier op de wereld in een groot boek geschreven je wordt
niet gevierd omdat je een goede daad hebt verricht maar
wl zul je je belning ontvangen bij de goede vader daar
boven god die alles ziet die zal je betalen daarom
zgt een arme altijd una iimosna por el amor de dios
je leest vaak in de kranten dat er weer zo of zoveel
duizenden guldens gevraagd of gegeven worden voor een of
ander hotel of iets dergelijks maar hoe dikwijls lees je
tgeld of hulp gevraagd voor de  armen en dan is aruba
nog maar zo klein hoe zal dat dan wel zijn in andere delen
van de grote wereld
laat ons eens denken aan al diegenen die echt veel zor
gen hebben die bang zijn voor de dag van morgen
kun je zlf niet helpen bid dan tenminste voor hen en bid
dat er meer mensen zullen inzien dat ze moeten helpen

ra pa coron vervolgblfebruari onze schoolavond zoals alle andere school
avonden zouden we ook deze keer dansen
ondanks de grote drukte die op beide scholen vooraf
ging werd het r c a gebouw die avond toch niet zo erg
druk bezocht er waren wel meisjes en jongens genoeg
maar we kregen toch de indruk dat lang niet alle leerlingen
van de de en de klassen van beide scholen tegenwoordig
waren
het feest zou om half acht beginnen maar het was over
achten toen de voortreffelijke teenersband van de tru
pialen een vrolijk lied inzette
nadat onze hoofdredakteur emile herd iedereen een
hartelijk welkom had toegeroepen opende hij het feest met
onze ijverigste redaktrice olga buckley na deze openings
dans verschenen meer paartjes op de vloer maar de zaal bleef
halfvoltot de steelband inzette met zijn vrolijke op
gewekte tonen men raakte op slag in de echte carnavals
stemming bijna iedereen begon te zingen en te springen en
we zagen zowaar ook enkele onderwijzers meehuppelen op de
maat van de muziek natuurlijk
zuster dorothea was in het begin van de avond even aan
wezig maar ging tamelijk vroeg naar huis jammer genoeg
misschien had ze haar pupillen niet eens herkend als ze hen
zo had zien jurnpen een onderwijzer van het mc werd zo
waar door n van zijn leerlingen ten dans gevraagd dat
had hij nooit durven dromen en zielsgelukkig leidde hij haar
naar de dansvloer waar hij bewees een uitstekende dans
partner te zijn
ook zagen wij andere onderwijzers met leerlingen dansenvan wie we beslist kunnen verzekeren nietdoor de dames te
zijn gvpaagjj opvallend was het wel dat er bijia geen leer
krachten van ht lsc aanwezig waren terwijl die van het
mc op een enkele na present varen
ife rekten het feest tot over twaalven nog n set met
los principes bedelde men bn daarna moest de steekband
nog een opwindende set weggeven
bet was tegen kwart voor een toen de meisjes hun reeds
wachtende ouders buiten opzochten een geslaagde schoolfuif
was ten einde
hulde aan frre gerardo zuster dorothea frre arnold de
band van de trupialen los principes en de stealband en aan
iedereen die heeft meegewerkt om onze schoolfuif tot een
aangename en onvergetelijke avond te maken

laatst wandelde ik langs de beach bet was een zonnige
zaterdagmiddag terwijl ik daar in het witte zand liep begon
ik tfeer luchtkastelen te bouwen dat deed ik nu altijd als ik
niets te doen had qpens dacht ik he wat zou het leuk zijn
om filmster te worden ba dat was net iets voor mij ik oe
doel natuurlijk niet een van die kleine niet beroemde film
sterretjes maar een fameuze acteur ja zo iemand als paul
newmand charlton ifeston of gregory peck zon acteur zou ik
willen worden
een filmster die grote rollen krijgt een filmster die
over de gehele wereld bekend is en die duizenden fans heeft
dan zou ik wel drie of vier mensen moeten betalen om al de
post te beantwoorden en het geld oh ik zou dan zoveel geld
verdienen dat ik alles zou kunnen k open wat ik wil
eerst zou ik een huis bouwen van vijf a zes kamers het
een grote tuin een zwembad twee garages enz twee garages
ja want ik koop twee autos n voor mijn dagelijkse werk
een ford mustang en een voor s zondagseen polls royce
ook zou ik veel aandelen kopen en een grote zaak oprichten
zodat wanneer ik oud ben ik mijn schaapjes op het droge zal
hebben n natuurlijk zal ik ook amical helpen met dui
zenden dollars
en trouwen trouwen wee hoor trouwen do ik niet in
ieder geval niet als ik filmster ben want zon leven leiden
als richard burton en nog een paar van die venten dat wji ik
niet we ir un hebben met al diemeisjes uit bolliwoodi ja
dat wel maar trouwen neen ieder geval voorlopig niet
maar j dat zal ik later wel beslissen als ik fllkister ben

als je op aruba in de stad gaat rondlopen dan betekent
dat eigenlijk niet zoveel als eldersbier betekent dat
allsn maar lopen in n straat do nassaustratml
yaarkun je a nders gaan als je oe n zijstraat inslaat
dan ben je eigenlijk al op yjog naar huis maar n ding is
zeker als je va n het ene eind naar het andere loopt on te
rug duurt dat zeker d r ie kwartier
ten eerste loop je op je gemak met een vriend eh dan
loop je maariom te lopen je staat vijf minuten voor elke
etalage en kies je geliefde coats shirts en broeken uit
soms ga je een winkel binnen alleen ma ar om er de
mensen la stig te vallens dan zoek je oen paar dingen opje
vraagt hoeveel zo kosten on je zegt da n heel serieuss sor
ry ik heb mar tien gulden bij me maarals je da n pech
hebt zegge n ze je dat je het voor deze keer ook voor
tien gulden kant krijgen dan moet je zelf maar zien om
je uit die hacho lijke toestand te redden
onde r hot wandelen ontmoet je a f n toe eons een
vriend of vriendin waarmee je ook w eer vijf minutenbezig
bentj na nog vpol etalagegekijk en babbeltjes hier en daar
koo je dan aan het andere eind hier sta je dan nog een tijd
je naarde voorbijgangers te kijken en de terugreis va ngt
weer arm
de terugreis gaat met dezelfde snelheid en met de nodig
tussenlandingen maar nu langs dezuidelijke route
ongeveerihalvorwegh ga jk een cafeetje binnenom iets
to gebruikenvoor n jjopsi eb je zeker vijftien minuten
nodig om hot op te drinponen dan stapje maar weer opy
on over co n kwartier ben je weer aan het eind punt
daar sta je dan weer op je gaiak zon twintig minuten voor
dat j weer met je reis begint maar nu eerst vid de zuide
lijke route om dan weer langs de noordelijke route ter ug
te keren
wanneer je dit heerlijke geslenter moe bont ga je
naar huis om de volgende dag weer met je goedbovallcnreis
te beginnen
zo zijn er mens en die dat jaren aan nstuk volhouden
maar ikzelf ee rlijk gezegd had er de eerste keer al ge

vermoeide correctors door de telefoon ik heb hier twee
blaadjes van jouw klas waar geen naam op staat weet jij
misschien welke jongens van jouw klas geen naam hebben
collega neen het spijt me maar ik kan je niet helpen ik
heb toevallig de namenlijst van mijn klas hier voor me
liggen maar ik zie niemand die geen naam heeft vraag
het de jongens morgen zelf maar eens die weten zeker of
ze een naam hebben of niet
corrector dank je bedankt voor die hint peinzend vreemd
dat die man niet weet wie van zijn leerlingen geen naam
heeft bet schooljaar is nu al ongeveer zes maanden bezig
waarschijnlijk is hij wat vermoeid de vacantie is
ook al weer zo lang voorbij
ingezonden door een leraarceen no i v at m
op sterk aandringen van de kant van de redaktre en
ook vanwege een zekere vroeging van mijn kant besluit
ik in een opwelling om maar weer is naar mijn trouwe ganzen
veer te grijpen
ik ben opgeruimd en vol goede moed iyaar zullen we
het deze keer over hebben over kostscholen ik zit niet op
een internaat dus dat gaat alvast niet toch wel jammer
maar afin de redaktie heb ik maar pas een keer met een be
zoek vereerd kunnen we ook wel laten vallen dus nou ja
zo erg is het nu ook weer niet ze kunnen mijn kritiek best
missen niet dat ik me er iets van aantrek hoor dat niet
maar toch
komaan wat zit ik hier nog verder te mediteren ik
moet een onderwerp zien te vinden een onderwerp waar ik
over schrijven kan waar ik over schrijven kan als een
meester wa rneq ikde lezers en lezerressen van bdk
door mijn frapante stijl ons colegio wat ahw in
boeien kan slaan sst niemand heeft me toch gehoord
ze moesten een weten dat ik eigenlijk maar een doodgewone
opschepper ben neen gelukkig niemand in de buurt
hn kwestie vietnam dan maar kom nou laat ik nou
niet den alsof ik er iets van afweet als het or poli
tiekvan het eerste plan aankomt heb ik er toch geen kaas
van gegeten ook al van de baan dus
blijft niet veel over wel de school komaan ik ben
toch niet meer op school ik zit op het colegio ahum
maar wat zwam ik toch ik moet toch wel iets kunnen vin
den een boom gaan opzetten over de aspecten van de ruim
tevaart een boom op schrift zeker bovendien snappen
den ze het toch niet de uilskuikenstut tut niet zo hoog van de toren blazen jongeman
of moet ik zeggen verwaande kwast een beetje meer be
scheiden kan het ook wel hoor tr dat was de stem uit mijn
binnenstee moet ik me daaraan storen eenvoud siert de mens
toe maar toch begin ik te geloven dat ik een beetje blas
wordtmaar nu begin ik mijn geduld te verliezen overigens
zij opgemerkt dat ik niet zo gauw mijn geduld verlies
daar is wel wat voor nodig al zeg ikhet zelf ik zou het
zo willen stellen dat ik toch wel een hm nou vooruit
dan maar dat ik over het algemeen toch wel een evenwicht je
natuur bezit bezit ik misschien ook nog een heldere oogop
slag waarmee ik in een oogwenk mijn hele omgeving op zijn
waarde kan taxeren neen toch maar niet nooit teveel van
het goeie willen hebben zo
opschepper pendante vent als je toch zoveel goede
eigenschappen hebt waarom kom je dan niet op een onderwerp
als jouw bijdrage voor bdk yiaarom niet nou dan
dat was alweer die stem uit mijn binnenste moet ik hem nou
het zwijgen opleggen of niet ik begin mezelf te verfoeien
bovendien wat zal de redaktie zeggen als ik met hangende
pootjes terugkom zonder onderwerp met alleen een paar
onbenullige zinnen op papier
toch maar de redaktie weer eens onder schot nemen
ze zien me al aankomen hoe komt ie alweer op zon origi
neel idee en ik voor aap staan zeker dan maar geen
onderwerp ik vertik het me nog langer suf te moeten pie
keren ik heb er tabak van geen inspiratie deze keer

groeten van een trouw schrijver en lezer uit nederlands
juist te laat voor het vorige nummer kregen we een postkaart
van onze vriend carlos trindad die sinds enige maanden in
den haag zit en zijn schoolkameraden nog niet vergeten is
hij vindt het erg koud in het koude land en het was in het
begin nogal moeilijk om er te wennen het wordt nu lekker
warm en we hopen dat het wennen ook beter zal worden

weer kunnen we schrijven de beruchte cps zijn
weer voorbij een hele opluchting vooral voor diegenen
die er heel hard voor gebl o kt hebben de resultaten zullen
uitwijzen hoe we er voorstaan we lopen zo langzaam
aan naar het einde van dit schooljaar en gedachten van
overgaan en zittenblijven spelen al door menig hoofdje
xn ieder geval staat de heerlijke pamsvacantie voor de
deur die gaat in ieder geval door nietwaar misschien
mogen we wel zeggen behalve voor de de klassers yuant
voor hei loert het schrifielijk examen al om het hoslje

geef ons de vrede wordt er da
delijks in honderdenkerken op de
wereld gebeden
de oorlog is geindigd nu leven
we in vrede leren de schoolkin
deren braaf uit hun boekje
natuurlijk niemand voert oorlog
maar betekent dat dat de wereld nu
in volkomen rust en vreedzaamheid
voortloeft is het woord vrede
merkelijk een juiste tegenstelling
van oorlog
was het maar waarl zelfs hier op onze antillen waar naar
het schijnt iedereen in harmonie samenleeft gebeuren er vaak
ellendige ongelukken waarbij een moeder in en dag drie kin
deren moet afstaan aan de eeuwigheid zal die moeder ooit
vrede krijgen in haar verdere leven
moordgepleegd door een broer op zijn bloedeigen zus
een meisje dat met haar broer in een auto rijdt komt in het
ziekenhuis terecht en als ze bijkomt wordt haar verteld
haar broer is dood
zullen de negers in het zuiden van de verenigde staten ooit
begrijpen dat dezelfde blanke amerikanen die nu hun leven
tot oen hel maken eens nog in deze twintigste eeuw vrede
gesleten hebben met de hele wereld
of de cubanen die nu lijden onder de tirannieke regering van
g stro zouden zij meegezucht hebben van opluchting
samen mot ons toen tuisland zijn schepen terugtrok na de be
slissende uitspraak van kennody gelukkig er was bijna
oorlcgi
do mensen in vietnam wier pasgeboren kinderen het woord het
bedrieglijke woord vrede nooit zullen kennenen zo zijn er ontelbare gevallen te noemen over heelde
wereld
het is te bgrijpen dat bij het horen van de woordens

plannenvaneentiemerclubhet onderstaande azen
we in een krant van
een klein dorp in nederland deze tieners wilden iets mr
doen  er was een oude man bij n van de leiders ge
komen hij zei jullie hebben zoveel jongekerels en flinr
ke meisjes kan er niet eentje mij komen helpen want ik
ben te oud en te stijf om houtjes voor de kachel te hakken
er werd in de vergadering nog een brief voorgelezen ik
ben zo verschrikkelijk eenzaam ik ken geen gezellig
heid thuis als ik sterf huilt er geen mens om mij
niemand zal mij missen
toen kwamen ineens de plannen het jeugdig idealisme brak
los m zullen de mensen gaan opzqeken die ons nodig heb
ben die vu kunnen helpen
ze gingen de zieken opzoeken vooral die eenzaam thuis
in bed lagen er werd voor hen gewerkt eten gekookt en
vooral heel veel gepraat want dat doen die zo graag
zieke leerlingen werden opgezocht en de lessen van de
school werden uitgelegd
invaliden werden rondgereden in hun wagentjes op plaat
sen waar ze nog nooit geweest waren de ogen van deze
vergeten mensen stradlden
huismoeders zagen meisjes voor hen de was doen en naai
en en de babysittersm zorgden voor de kinderenzoals je veet ben ik op weg naar mijn tweede jaar hier in
holland achteraf gezen gaat het heel vlug als je hier zit
begrijp ie het spreekwoord tijd is geld ook veel beter
hier gaat alles n op een hoog tempo bijvoorbeeld om zoals
op apuba eventjes onder een kwihiboom te gaan rusten en een
dutjp te doen hoef je zelf niet in je hoofd te krijgen hier
daar is het trouwens te koud voer
je bent hier maar al bezig en moet je leren je tijd goed
te verdelen over de belangrijkste dingen die je te doen hebt
als v de leraren je daar op aruba zeggen jongens gebruik
en besteed je tijd goed want niet overal op de wereld heb je
zon overvloed van tijd dan denk je in jezelf klets niet
man de tijd is afhankelijk of beter gezegd houd verband met
de klok en die loopt overal op de wereld even vlug maar
laten we maar van dit onderwerp afstappen tijd is n zotn
moeilijke kwestie dat zelfs eins tein er zich jaren mee bezig
hield en zijn re lat ivite ittheor ie samenstelde
deze dagen vroor hut wel vier weken achter mekaar en zijn
allesloten meertjes en kanalen dicht gaan liggen nou ein
delijk kan ik gaan leren schaatsen vorig jaar kon dat niet
wantten hadden we n en zacht wintertje nou hier kunnen
zelfs de kleinste wezentjes schaatsen dus ik zou het en moest
het ook leren ts avonds laat om half twaalf ging ik met minguel
reyes schaatsen nou schaatsen kun je eigenlijk niet zeggen
het was strompelen vallenen opstaan zwaaien en glijden
ja het had meer iets van kunstschaatsen na een les of
konden we ons vooruitbewegen en gingen toen ook overdag met
een jroep jongelui schaatsen
ik moet behoorlijk hard werken ant in mijn klas zitten
vele hbsluitjes en u tsers nou daar moet ik tegenop
kunnen en laten zien wat ik met mfn lasalliaanse mulob di

de meeste keren dat er over de jeugd geschreven wordt
gebeurt dit door volwassenen hun mening over ons is niet al
tijd erg gunstig het zou wel interessant zijn om nu iets
over dit onderwerp te lezen geschreven door een jeugdig per
soon
vaak horen wij volwassenen zuchten maar moet dat naar
toe met die jeugd van tegenwoordigj ze kunnen niets anders
dan myeahyeah schreeuwen en hun ouders grijze haren be
zorgen nu mag een meisje gerust helemaal alleen de straat
op vroeger was dat onmogelijk en de kleding van tegenwoordig
daar vinden de ouderen ook niets aan r is veel veranderd
maar zeker niet in ongunstige zin de moderne jeugd houdt er
van om lekker gek te doen althans een deel van de jongelui
niet iedere jongeling moet beschouwd worden als een nozem of
beatlefan mijn vrienden en ik bv houden helemaal niet van
beatmuziek en wij doen niet an de beatlerage mee me houden
meer van zuidamerikaanse muziek en vinden jongens met lange
haren alleen maar belachelijk in de buurt waar mijn vrienden
wonen zie je nooit zon nozem met lange manen slordige kleren
en een stank vanwege het zelden baden dor zulke gekke ge
woonten halen ze zich alleen maar onze minachting op de hals o
de mening van oudere mensen dat de jeugd nu veel bal
dadiger is dan vroeger vind ik totaal in strijd met de waar
heid door de nozems en andere jongelui die niet goed wijs
zijn wordt hun een totaal verkeerd beeld gegeven van wat de
moderne jeugd is voor zulke jongens en meisjes die zich pro
vos noemen en soms zelfs muizen in hun kleren laten leven
en in hun mond laten kruipen kan ik geen enekel woord van
waardering opbrengen bet zou beter zijn als zij dat onfrisse
gedoe vergaten en wat meer aan gezonde sport gingen doen
ik ben tegen nozem s en provots en zulke dingen maar ik
wil niet dat zij als voorbeeld van de hele moderne jeugd aan
de kaak gesteld worden yvant zij vormen het deel vande jeugd
dat in de ogen van de volwassenen het voor de anderen bederven

nze missieaktie
twee jaar geleden heeft onze school een seminarist geadop
teerd dat is paul raj die studeert in bangalore in het verre
indik het land dat tegenwoordig volop in het nieuws is wegens
de honger en de armoede vah dit miljoenenvolk
onder dat adopteren verstonden we toen een bijdrage van
het na salie college om te helpen dat hij een goed priester zou
wordh een goed leider onder zijn volk een mens die in staat
zou pijn om god dichter bij zijn volk en om het indiase volk
dichter bij god te brengen
die hulp bestaat uit ons gebd en ons offer
ons gebed is moeilijk uit te tellen maar het is wel erg
voorpaam christus zelf spoort ons aan m in gns gebed arbei
ders te vragen in zijn wijngaardons offer bestaat uit een geldelijke bijdrage liefst geen
geld uit de buidel van vader of moeder maar zelf gespaard
van ons zakgeld dat is wel uit te tellen de studiekosten van
paulraj bedragen ongeveer naf
dat komt dus per klas op een kleine twintig gulden per
jaar de klas die daar onder blijft rekent on andere klassen
waar de jongens er meer voor over hebben en dat is niet
sportief
laten we er een erezaak van maken in elke klas die
twintig gulden te halen

fr norbertussonia schiet op klonk de stem van mijn broertje in
j de gang ik deed gauw mijn polshorloge om pakte mijntasje en
kwam de kamer uit daar stond mijn broertje trappele ndvan
ongeduld op me te wachten schiet toch op we komen te laat
mama en papa wachten al lang op jouik ben al klaar hoor
i kom maar mee ik nam hem bij de hand en samen gingenwe naar
de huiskamer
ringgsrgj de bel ging wie zou daar zijn misschien was
het wel een van de deugnieten die weer aan de bel trokken ik
besloot maar niet te gaan kijken en liep naar de huiskamer o
voor ik de deur van de huiskamer binnenging klonk het weer
j ringggj ik draaide me om en liep naar de deur terwijl ik
dacht wie zou er in godsnaam toch hier aanbellen op zotn on
i verwachte tijd ik maakte open en even later stond ik voor een
onbekende nogal wat oude man die me vroeg of mijn vader thuis
was ik liet hem binnen en vroeg wie ik kon zeggen dat er was
tegelijkertijd dacht ik had ik hem maar gezegd dat vader er
niet was misschien zal hij nu wel een lang gesprek met vader
aanknopen en dan zouden we te laat komen voor de f ilm
ik ging naar de huiskamer toe en vertelde pa dat meneer
earold smiths er was vader stond verbaasds harold smfhhsv
herhaalde hij laat hem binnen wie is hij vroeg moeder o
hij is een oudbuurman van mij toen ik nog een jongen was
heb ik hem eens geplaagd hij heeft me toen een flink pak
slaag gegeven en sindsdien is hij ook de stad uitgegaan
meneer halley kwam binnen groette vader hartelijk gaf moeder
een hand en tikte mijn broertje even op de wang deze trok een
gezicht tegen hem moeder zag dit en gaf me een wenk om met
hem naar buiten te gaan ik pakte hem bij de hand en samen
gingen we naar de auto het was ifyirart voor vier en om vier
uur zou de film beginnen gaan we nog vroeg mijn broertje
ja zei ik maar eerst moet die meneer vertrekken
even was het stil toen zei hij weer ik wil niet in
de auto blijven ik wil naar binnen naar die meneer
ik vermoedde niet wat zijn plan was dus starten wij uit en
gingen wre naar de huiskamer
daar aangekomen vonden we onze ouders druk in gesprek met de
meneer mijn broertje die pas vijf was en een ehte deug
niet stapte recht op de meneer af pakte zijn hand vast en
ze ij u moet nou weg gaan want wij moeten naar de film
moeder werd rood ik zelf stond daar als aan de grond ge
nagald vader wist niet wat te zeg en en de meneer
hij lachte tegen mijn broertje en z ei bet spijt me maar
ik wist niet dat hij naar de film moets met je papa en mama
hij stond pp en gaf vader een hand vader wilde zich veront
schuldigen maar daar wilde hij niets van horen kinderen
zijn kinderen het zijn ook de enigen die met de waarheid
voor de dag komen ik zal wel een andere keer langs komen
zei hij hij groette ons allen en vertrok
het was vijf voor vier vfe stapten gauw in de auto en waren
juist op tijde al kregen wij geen goede plaats meer we waren
er toch dank zij mijn broertje

uit een opstel en toen slaakte hij een hart van verzuch
tingoor in
laatst wandelde ik langs de beach bet was een zonnige
zaterdagmiddag terwijl ik daet in het witte zand liep begon
ik zo te riekeren over alles en nog wat opeens dacht ik be
watzou dat leuk zijn om voor n dag als onderwijzer voor de
klas te staantt natuurlijk waren er voordelen en nadelen aan
verbonden maar het zou toch wel mee kunnen vallen ik zou die
da bijvoorbeeld wat vroeger op school moeten zijn als onder
wijzer hoort dat nu eenmaal kaar dat was zo erg niet want
zo klein gesprek met de andere onderwijzers voor schooltijd
was wel leuk vooral omdat ik ze nu collegafs zou kunnen noe
men
ook zou ik in elke klas willen komen in de zevende klas
zou ik krans en algebra les geven dat zijn nu eenmaal mijn
twee slechtste vakken maar ik denk wel dat ik er genoeg van
afweet om die reuters van de zevende klas nog wat bij te le
ren in de achtste klas zou ik ze wat spaans en aardrijkskunde
geven o wat over de pretr ito en weet ik nog meer als ik
daar doorheen kom denk ik wel dat het voor de rest zal slagen
want daar zitten nu eenmaal de grote vlegels
onder het speelkwartier zou ik de
wacht willen hebben iedereen zou die
n maca
dag vrij mogen vreglopen om even
ron te gaan kopen als ze mij ook maar
niet zoudenvergeten en daarna onder
de godsdienstles
in de de klas
lekker koffie drin
i j ken en de jongens
n v  f even allemaal weer
a v v p gede spoor
t brengen daarna
xi tekenles in een
i andere negende klas
v l rmrn yvi v vi reven wat moderne
kunst en weet ik
nogwat meer hat is gemakkelijk niet om iets te
vinden wat ze allemaal leuk vinden
in de tiende klas kan ik natuurlijk het laatst
daar zou ik ze wel ecu leren wat nu eigenlijk vela
is en mijn laatste les ik kies natuurlijk een dins
dar f een donderdag zou ik gymles in a geven eerst
vijf minuten lichaamsoefeningen ze hebben er nu een
maal een hekel aan en daarna volleyball natuurlijn
ga ik dan ook meespek n om ze ven te laten zien dao
een onderwijzer ook vlot kan zijn
maar na zon dag denk ik wel dat ikhet niet meer
in miin hoofd zal halen om het nog eens te proberen
onderwijzer worden nee dat is niets voor mij en
vooral niet op het lsc want daar is het heus geen
aartsparadijs hoor

dat richard piternella gedurende twee jaargangen de puzzel
redakteur van bao di kwihi ons nog niet vergeten is bewijst

hem helemaal kloppend te maken
richard schrijft verder in een brief aan de redaktie dat hij
het verder uitstekend maakt dat hij blij is dat de ergste
kou voorbij is en dat er zelfs al weer een beetje zon is
verder ontvangen redaktie en abonnees zijn hartelijke groeten
en belooft hij nog een artikel over het zijn leven in neder

u
pauselijk missiewerk yoor eiger ehesters dat onze
seminarist in india paul r a j op a april
priesier gewij zou worden
veel jongens van het la salle college waren aangenaam verrast
het was dan ook mooi nieuws de laatste tijd is india wel erg
in het nieuws geweest hadden wij een mooier antwoord kunnen
geven op het alarm dat er geslagen is wij hebben met onze
spaaroenten en met ons gebed aan het indiase volk een
eigen prlester gegeven
hopelijk kunnen we in het volgende nummer van bao di xwihi
p
iets laten horen van paul raj zelf  nu is de vraag
gaan we een nieuwe seminarist adopteren het antwoord hoe b

vervolg onze eevolking
door i aura vffirnei
twee nannen kregen eens ruzie over him afkonst rwat
verbeeld je je vel zsi de een je dent niet anders dan n
doodgewone indiaan dat je een blanke kleur hebt is alleen
naar te danken aan het engelse schip dat jaar geleden
hier voor aruba ankerde de indiaantjes die zich tussen het
hoge gras foenfoen genaaad bevonden zagen het wonderdingze trippelden als gekken naar het schip toe en de engel
sen anuseerden zich kostelijk net die lcleine wezentjes ze
strooiden pinda op het dek on ze te lokken de indiaantjes
anuseerden zich k ze lieten zich lokken door de blanken
en toen ze later aan land gingen tussen het hoge gras en hun
rustig leventje weer voortzetten verden er allenaal blanke
kinderjes geboren
en die indianen zijn onze stanouders van nij van jou
en van de neeote arubanen en nou jiji
oxoxoxoxoxo
de verschillende schepen hebben ons de versohillende
bewoners gebracht spanjaarden hollanders engelsen fran
sen en portugezen de spanjaarden kwanen het eerst naar
men xegt ongeveer tien jaar na de ontdeldcing van anerika
die brachten het katholieke geloof en ze behandelden de in
dianen goed
maar al heel gauw kwanen kapers op de leust de nensen
noenden ze piraten en die piraten waren hollanders
ze roof den wat ze konden en waarschi jnli jk vemoordden ze
k wat ze konden k het katholieke geloof
nu kennen we de nederlanders als goede rette nensen
en de elite nederlanders oa do priesters de zusters do
freres nensen die hier zijn gokonen voor de verspreiding
van het veloof en voor de opvoeding die zijn zulke edele
nensen als je naar zelden tegenkont maar die hollanders
van de de eeuw waren ruwe zeevaarders avonturicrs on ze
kwamen hier alleminst on hot geloof te vcrspreiden
later kwamen de engelsen natuurlijk ook geen fijae jon
getjes en die speelden ook een tijdje de baas zelfs de
franson noeten het geprobeerd hebben zich neester te naken
van het eiland texuninste dat be we re n sonnige nensen ze ver
tellen dat rooi france s herinnert aan die tijd toon er
slag geleverd werd tussen de bewoners en de franseny de heu
vels bij rooi frances werden hun waterloo want ze werden tot
de laatste nan verbrand in hun schuilplaats
anderen noenen het gevluchte fransen die daar een schuil
plaats hadden gezocht naar de bevolking verdacht ze van hin
der goede bedoelingen ze werden verbrand naar enkelen wis
ten te ontsnappen en bleven hier wonen in ieder geval koes
teren nog steeds heel wat nensen vrees voor deze pick er is
heel wat nocd voor nodig on s nachts deze weg te nenen
en degenen die dat s nachts doen zien en horen altijd
wat t zijn de geesten van de fransen die daar vernoord
zijn anderen die minder last van hun geweten hebben hebben
doze plaats wel eens gebruikt on te verstoppen wat ze graag
kwijt willen er is dan ook neer dan eens een lijk gevonden
volgens onze oudere generatie bestond de bevolking uit
die tijd enkel uit neesters en slaven maar er kwamen steeds
nieuwe families bij die dan goon slaven waren hollanders
de zg zwarte fransen mulatten indianen uit colombia
zelfs joodse nanen stonden in die tijd hier bekend
de neesters shon waren neestal hollanders naar or wa
re n ook neesters die niet blank waren en ook nict zeer rijk
deze shons waren niet kieskeurig in de keuze van hun echt
genote n  zo lcreeg je veel slavinnenkinderen net een
aardje naar hun vaartje en die waren dan echt blank
in vyerd de slave mi j afgeschaft we kregen een vrije
arubaanse bevolking die zijn kost verdlende in de goudbedrij
de laatste dagen van maart gebeurde er z we ini g op
school om te vermelden in onze kroniek en wat we al
van de maand april gehad hebbenwas gelukkig vaka n
tie diontengovolge hebben we dan ook maar heel
veinig nieuys voor ons j ournaal
